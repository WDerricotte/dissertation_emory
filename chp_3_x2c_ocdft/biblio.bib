	abstract  ="Fitting used to simplify various approximations to the molecular Schrodinger equation is discussed. Robust fits correct the target function to first order in the error made due to fitting. Variational fits are compatible with the variational principle. A full variation of the fitted energy is used to generate the Fock matrix. Robust and variational fitting of the electric and magnetic fields of the electrons is defined. Robust-fitted MP2 (RF-MP2) methods are defined. Independent of how the charge distributions are fit{,} robust-fitted errors are quadratic in the difference between the fits and fitted quantities. Analytic{,} robust and variational fits of various fractional powers of electronic densities and other linear-combination-of-atomic-orbitals (LCAO) objects are described."}

The local exchange approximation is used, but the usual muffin-tin approximation for potentials or densities is avoided. Procedures specifically optimized for treating large systems, such as transition-metal complexes, are developed. Some illustrative results are given for small molecules. We show that one-electron energies can be calculated rapidly and that the charge distribution is also easily obtained. Total energies, and therefore optim- ized molecular geometries, require more computation time."

A{,} 2013{,} 117{,} 7378] is a variational time-independent approach for the computation of electronic excited states. In this work we extend OCDFT to compute core-excited states and generalize the original formalism to determine multiple excited states. Benchmark computations on a set of 13 small molecules and 40 excited states show that unshifted OCDFT/B3LYP excitation energies have a mean absolute error of 1.0 eV. Contrary to time-dependent DFT{,} OCDFT excitation energies for first- and second-row elements are computed with near-uniform accuracy. OCDFT core excitation energies are insensitive to the choice of the functional and the amount of Hartree-Fock exchange. We show that OCDFT is a powerful tool for the assignment of X-ray absorption spectra of large molecules by simulating the gas-phase near-edge spectrum of adenine and thymine."}

In this perspective{,} we review recent developments in quantum chemical calculations of X-ray absorption spectra{,} focusing on the use of time-dependent density functional theory to study core excitations. The practical application of these calculations is illustrated with examples drawn from surface science and bioinorganic chemistry{,} and the application of these methods to study X-ray emission spectroscopy is explored."}

Most molecules in liquid water are in two hydrogen–bonded configurations with one strong donor and one strong acceptor hydrogen bond in contrast to the four hydrogen–bonded tetrahedral structure in ice. Upon heating from 25°C to 90°C, 5 to 10% of the molecules change from tetrahedral environments to two hydrogen–bonded configurations. Our findings are consistent with neutron and x-ray diffraction data, and combining the results sets a strong limit for possible local structure distributions in liquid water.

In most cases{,} the calculations are compared to polarized experimental spectra.

abstract  ="A series of mononuclear V(V){,} V(IV) and V(III) complexes were investigated by V L-edge near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. The spectra show significant sensitivity to the vanadium oxidation state and the coordination environment surrounding the vanadium center. The L-edge spectra are interpreted with the aid of the recently developed Density Functional Theory/Restricted Open Shell Configuration Interaction Singles (DFT/ROCIS) method. This method is calibrated for the prediction of vanadium L-edges with different hybrid density functionals and basis sets. For the B3LYP/def2-TZVP(-f) and BHLYP/def2-TZVP(-f) functional/basis-set combinations{,} good to excellent agreement between calculated and experimental spectra is obtained. A treatment of the spin-orbit coupling interaction to all orders is achieved by quasi-degenerate perturbation theory (QDPT){,} in conjunction with DFT/ROCIS for the calculation of the molecular multiplets while accounting for dynamic correlation and anisotropic covalency. The physical origin of the observed spectral features is discussed qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of spin multiplicities{,} magnetic sublevels and individual 2p to 3d core level excitations. This investigation is an important prerequisite for future applications of the DFT/ROCIS method to vanadium L-edge absorption spectroscopy and vanadium-based heterogeneous catalysts."}

abstract = {The eigenstates of the matrix representation of the Dirac operator for c → ∞ do not approach their nonrelativistic counterparts in the same basis. This wrong “Schrödinger limit” is shown to be the main reason for the phenomenon known as “variational collapse.” After a short review of existing proposals to overcome the “variational collapse,” a systematic study of the possible ways to avoid it is given. All discussed approaches are analyzed in terms of various criteria that one wants to fulfill. The most promising approach consists of a free-particle Foldy–Wouthuysen (FW) transformation on operator level and a back transformation on matrix level (approaches C2 and C3). This implies a modification of the free-electron part of the matrix representation of the Dirac operator and leads to the correct Schrödinger limit (and if one wishes even the correct Pauli limit) in the same basis (and to the exact results for a complete basis). The potential energy is unchanged, which makes the application to n -electron systems straightforward. Projection of the Dirac operator to positive energy states does not remove the variational collapse unless this is done in a very special way.},

Although the RSGF approach has been widely used both for near edge (XANES) and extended (EXAFS) ranges{,} previous implementations relied on semi-phenomenological methods{,} e.g.{,} the plasmon-pole model for the self-energy{,} the final-state rule for screened core hole effects{,} and the correlated Debye model for vibrational damping. Here we describe how these approximations can be replaced by efficient ab initio models including a many-pole model of the self-energy{,} inelastic losses and multiple-electron excitations; a linear response approach for the core hole; and a Lanczos approach for Debye-Waller effects. We also discuss the implementation of these models and software improvements within the FEFF9 code{,} together with a number of examples."}

abstract = "Publisher Summary This chapter discusses statistical exchange-correlation in the self-consistent field. There are two sides to a self-consistent field calculation: the determination of the potential and the solution of Schrödinger's equation for the one-electron problem. The solution of Schrödinger's equation has fortunately advanced far enough through the application of the electronic digital computer so that it can be regarded for most purposes as being a standardized technique. The main point of the method of Gaspar, Kohn, and Sham is that they derive the approximate exchange correction from an approximate Hamiltonian for the system by varying the spin-orbitals to minimize the average value of this Hamiltonian for the ground state. The approximate Hamiltonian has many important and valuable features that are described in the chapter. "

The first part of the review discusses the basics of multiplet theory and respectively, atomic multiplets, crystal field effects and charge transfer effects are explained. The consequences of 3d-spin–orbit coupling and of 3d systems in symmetries lower than cubic are discussed. The second part of the paper gives a short overview of all X-ray spectroscopies, where the focus is on the multiplet aspects of those spectroscopies and on the various configurations that play a role in combined spectroscopies such as resonant photoemission, resonant X-ray emission and coincidence spectroscopy. The review is concluded with a section that gives an overview of the use of multiplet theory for 3d coordination compounds. Some new developments are sketched, such as the determination of differential orbital covalence and the inclusion of π-(back)bonding. "

Expensive storing and retrieving of integrals is thereby avoided and applications on large species possible. As a demonstration we calculate the discrete and continuum near-edge X-ray absorption spectra for molecules in the n-alkylnitrile sequence CH3(CH2)nCN. "

The dependence of the calculated results on the size of the \{AO\} basis and on scaling the valence and inner shells is discussed, and a direct comparison between the localized and delocalized \{CI\} treatments for the 1s ionization potential of ethylene is undertaken. In general very good agreement is obtained between calculation and experiment with respect to both energies and intensities of peaks which have been observed in electron impact and synchrotron radiation work, although several modifications in the assignment of the experimental findings are suggested on the basis of the present computations. The shake-up states possessing the same symmetry as the core-ionized species are also calculated, whereby the lowest such states (1s−1, π → π*) in \{C2\} \{H2\} and \{C2\} \{H4\} are found to be in the 6–7 eV region above the K edge. All calculated shake-up data match well with the obsion and \{CH\} stretching modes in ethylene and associated Franck—Condon factors for 1B3u(1s → π*) — X 1Ag transitions show unambiguously that the observed vibrational structure in this ethylene band system corresponds to a progression in the \{CH\} stretching vibration.

The scheme consists to reduce the complete one-electron excited configurations space to the subspace where only the core electrons are excited. The scheme has been applied to the Ti 1s, Ti 2p and Cl 2p core excitations of TiCl4, employing different basis sets and exchange correlation potentials. The comparison with the experimental data is good, especially for the Ti 2p shell which cannot be described even qualitatively by the too simple Kohn–Sham method. Also the Cl 2p shell, dominated by Rydberg features, is properly described. The method is computationally economic, and can be applied to larger and less symmetric systems. Further extensions to the relativistic case, with explicit spin–orbit treatment, are suggested to improve the description of spin–orbit splitting and intensity redistributions. "

their implementation in the COLUMBUS program system are reported. These new features are: calculation of the analytical MR-CI gradient for excited states based on state-averaged MCSCF orbitals{,} the extension of the MR-ACPF/AQCC methods to excited states
in the framework of linear-response theory{,} spin-orbit CI for molecules containing heavy atoms and the development of a massively-parallel code for the computation of the one- and two-particle density matrix elements. Illustrative examples are given for
each of these cases."}

  abstract={A diagonalisation procedure of the Foldy-Wouthuysen type is considered for the single-electron Dirac Hamiltonian as a basis for many-body applications. A modified procedure is suggested. In the diagonalisation procedure the Dirac equation is completely decoupled into two equations of the Pauli type. The expressions for positive- and negative-energy projection operators in the transformed basis are then trivial and, by performing the inverse transformation, projection operators for Dirac functions are obtained. Applying a similar transformation to the two-electron Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian leads to a diagonalised single-electron part and a non-diagonal two-electron interaction. In principle, the effect of the exchange of virtual, transverse photons (Breit interactions) can also be included in the electron-electron interaction and transformed in a similar way. It is indicated how a diagonalisation procedure of this kind can be used as a basis for relativistic many-body calculations in the coupled cluster formulation in analogy with the corresponding non-relativistic procedure.}

Relativistic effects were treated by the spin-free, two-component infinite-order Douglas–Kroll–Hess, Dirac–Coulomb and the restricted active space state interaction RASSI–SO methods. Our adiabatic electron affinity (EA), 0.696&#xa0;eV, agrees favorably with experiment (0.714&#xa0;eV). Theoretical dissociation energies De of PbO and PbO− (3.91 and 3.20&#xa0;eV) differ from experiment by 0.04 and 0.07&#xa0;eV, respectively. The electron correlation, relativistic scalar and spin–orbit effects are crucial for obtaining good agreement of theoretical and experimental data for \{EA\} and De. Equilibrium bond distance and vibrational frequency are less sensitive to \{SO\} effects. "

abstract = "A hierarchy of approximations in relativistic many-electron theory is discussed that starts with the Dirac equation and its expansion in a kinetically balanced basis, via a formulation of non-interacting electrons in Fock space (which is the only consistent way to deal with negative-energy states). The most straightforward approximate Hamiltonian for interacting electrons is derived from quantum electrodynamics (QED) in Coulomb gauge with the neglect of transversal photons. This allows an exact (non-perturbative) decoupling of the electromagnetic field from the fermionic field. The electric interaction of the fermions is non-retarded and non-quantized. The quantization of the fermionic field leads to a polarizable vacuum. The simplest (but somewhat problematic) approximation is a no-pair projected theory with external-field projectors. The Dirac-Coulomb operator in configuration space (first quantization) is not acceptable, even if the Brown–Ravenhall disease is much less virulent than often claimed. Effects of transversal photons, such as the Breit interaction and renormalized self-interaction can be taken care of perturbatively at the end, but there are still many open questions. "

It is shown that the theory of effective Hamiltonians allows the determination of Pauli-like Hamiltonians that are regular enough to be used in variational calculations. A numerical illustration is given for hydrogenic atoms with atomic number varying from Z = 1 to Z = 86. These calculations yield relativistic correction potentials which are used for studying the series of neutral rare gas atoms. Our approach opens the way for accurate two-component calculations for molecules.}

None of the prominently used DFT approaches show these properties: the optimized effective potential VXC based ab initio dft does. A local, range-separated hybrid potential cam-QTP-00 is introduced as the basis for a “consistent”KS DFT approach. The computed VIPs as the negative of KS eigenvalue have a mean absolute error of 0.8 eV for an extensive set of molecule\&apos;s electron ionizations, including the core. Barrier heights, equilibrium geometries, and magnetic properties obtained from the potential are in good agreement with experiment. A similar accuracy with less computational efforts can be achieved by using a non-variational global hybrid variant of the QTP-00 approach.},

Vibrational structure in oxygen is 1s−1π* and Rydberg states was resolved for the first time. The derived molecular structure parameters are consistent with the Z+1 approximation. High-resolution, high-intensity core-level photoabsorption promises new opportunities in vibrational state-to-state chemistry and surface science. "

The singlet–triplet splitting for the (C 1s−1,π*) states of the hydrocarbon species were measured for the first time. Intermediate neglect of differential overlap (spectroscopic) ({INDO}/S) calculations within the equivalent cores approximation were used to calculate (1s−1, π*) singlet–triplet splittings. The calculated values are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values for the hydrocarbon species but are significantly underestimated for {CO}. A strong correlation between singlet–triplet splittings and oscillator strengths for the 1s → π* transitions was noted and rationalized in terms of the dependence of both factors on the spatial overlap of 1s and π* wave functions., Les états triplets (C 1s−1,π*) du monoxyde de carbone, du benzène, de l'éthylène ont été étudiés par spectroscopie de perte d'énergie des électrons, avec une énergie d'excitation voisine du seuil. La séparation singulet–triplet pour let états (C 1s−1,π*) des hydrocarbures a été mesurée pour la première fois. Le calcul de ces séparations a été effectué par la méthode {INDO}/S (Intermediate neglect of differential overlap/spectroscopic), à l'approximation des coeurs équivalents. Les valeurs calculées sont raisonnablement en accord avec les valeurs expérimentales pour les hydrocarbures, mais elles sont nettement trop basses dans le cas de {CO}. On a noté une forte corrélation entre les séparations singulet–triplet et les forces d'oscillation pour les transitions 1s → π*, ce qui peut s'expliquer par le fait que les deux facteurs dépendent de la superposition spatiale des fonctions d'ondes 1s et π*.

The 3σu* valence state is observed in the 3sσg Rydberg region with no mixing. The 3pσu state is found in the same region as the C1sσg→3pπu state, which shows only totally symmetric vibrations. This is the first to observe that the Rydberg state in C2H2 keeps gerade and ungerade symmetries without vibronic coupling through antisymmetric stretching vibrations related to core–hole localization. On the other hand, the lowest 1πg* valence state induces vibronic coupling through bending vibrations in the 3σu* and 3sσg states.},

Previously unobserved fine structure is resolved. The spectra of both molecules are characterized by multielectron excitations 8–14 {eV} above the L2 threshold energy, broad valence-shell absorption features 5–8 {eV} below the L2 edge, and many narrower Rydberg excitations 0–5 {eV} below the L2 edge. Comparison of the H2S and D2S spectra allows the identification of transitions which include vibrational excitation, due to the isotopic dependence of vibrational energies. For the (2p)-1 core-excited Rydberg states, a least-squares analysis was employed, which deconvoluted the core-level and excited-orbital splittings. Results show that the twofold degeneracy of the sulfur 2p3/2 core level is removed by the molecular field, with a resulting splitting of 115 {meV} for the higher-energy core-excited Rydberg states. The energies of the higher Rydberg states were well described by the Rydberg formula with the quantum defects δp=1.63 and δd=0.32. Fine structure was resolved in the transitions to the dissociative (2p)-1 core-excited valence-shell states. The regular spacing and isotopic dependence of this structure clearly identifies it as a vibrational progression.},

These auxiliary bases are slightly more than three times larger than orbital bases of split valence quality.
