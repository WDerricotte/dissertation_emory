The measurements were performed under catalytically relevant conditions within an in-house constructed reaction cell. The experimental {RIXS} plane is constructed from a sequence of resonances, covering the near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure ({NEXAFS}) spectrum up to 539 {eV}. The spectra show significant sensitivity with respect to the excitation frequency. The {NEXAFS} absorption spectrum, as well as the corresponding {RIXS} spectra, is interpreted with the aid of multireference configuration interaction ({MRCI}) theory. In this framework, the configuration interaction space spans the space of the intermediate and final states with single and single?double excitations. The dynamic character of the {RIXS} spectra is investigated by considering the electronic?nuclear vibrational coupling with the bending and antisymmetric stretching vibrations in the important intermediate excited states. In addition, the vibronic coupling mechanism involving the Renner?Teller effect and the core?hole localization pseudo-Jahn?Teller effect of the intermediate states is fully considered. The physical origin of the observed spectral features is discussed qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of individual core-to-valence excitations and valence-to-core decays, respectively. The computational protocol presented here, based on multireference wave function ab initio theory, serves as an important reference for future theoretical and experimental applications of {RIXS} spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {A novel restricted-open-shell configuration interaction with singles ({ROCIS}) approach for the calculation of transition metal L-edge X-ray absorption spectra is introduced. In this method, one first calculates the ground state and a number of excited states of the non-relativistic Hamiltonian. By construction, the total spin is a good quantum number in each of these states. For a ground state with total spin S excited states with spin S′ = S, S − 1, and S + 1 are constructed. Using Wigner-Eckart algebra, all magnetic sublevels with {MS} = S, …, −S for each multiplet of spin S are obtained. The spin-orbit operator is represented by a mean-field approximation to the full Breit-Pauli spin-orbit operator and is diagonalized over this N-particle basis. This is equivalent to a quasi-degenerate treatment of the spin-orbit interaction to all orders. Importantly, the excitation space spans all of the molecular multiplets that arise from the atomic Russell-Saunders terms. Hence, the method represents a rigorous first-principles approach to the complicated low-symmetry molecular multiplet problem met in L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In order to gain computational efficiency, as well as additional accuracy, the excitation space is restricted to single excitations and the configuration interaction matrix is slightly parameterized in order to account for dynamic correlation effects in an average way. To this end, it is advantageous to employ Kohn-Sham rather than Hartree-Fock orbitals thus defining the density functional theory/{ROCIS} method. However, the method can also be used in an entirely non-empirical fashion. Only three global empirical parameters are introduced and have been determined here for future application of the method to any system containing any transition metal. The three parameters were carefully calibrated using the L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy spectra of a test set of coordination complexes containing first row transition metals. These parameters are universal and transferable. Hence, there are no adjustable parameters that are used to fit experimental X-ray absorption spectra. Thus, the new approach classifies as a predictive first-principles method rather than an analysis tool. A series of calculations on transition metal compounds containing Cu, Ti, Fe, and Ni in various oxidation and spin states is investigated and a detailed comparison to experimental data is reported. In most cases, the approach yields good to excellent agreement with experiment. In addition, the origin of the observed spectral features is discussed in terms of the electronic structure of the investigated compounds.},

In the solid state, the slow decay of their nonlocal Hartree?Fock-type exchange makes hybrids computationally demanding and can introduce unphysical effects. Both problems can be remedied by a screened hybrid which uses exact exchange only at short-range. Many molecular properties, in contrast, benefit from the inclusion of long-range exact exchange. Recently, the authors reconciled these two seemingly contradictory requirements by introducing the {HISS} functional [J. Chem. Phys. 2007, 127, 221103], which uses exact exchange only in the middle range. In this paper, we expand upon our previous work, benchmarking the performance of the {HISS} functional for several simple properties and applying it to the dissociation of homonuclear diatomic cations and to the polarizability of linear H2 chains to determine the importance of middle-range exact exchange for these systems, which are expected to be sensitive to the asymptotic exchange potential.},

All excited configuration state functions ({CSFs}) are generated with the aid of a spin-free second quantization formalism that only leads to {CSFs} within the first order interacting space. By virtue of the {CSF} construction, the formalism involves higher than singly excited determinants but not higher than singly excited configurations. Matrix elements between {CSFs} are evaluated on the basis of commutator relationships using a symbolic algebra program. The final equations were, however, hand-coded in order to maximize performance. The method can be applied to fairly large systems with more than 100 atoms in reasonable wall-clock times and also parallelizes well. Test calculations demonstrate that the approach is far superior to {UHF}-based configuration interaction with single excitations but necessarily falls somewhat short of quantitative accuracy due to the lack of dynamic correlation contributions. In order to implicitly account for dynamic correlation in a crude way, the program optionally allows for the use of Kohn?Sham orbitals in combination with a modest downscaling of two-electron integrals ({DFT}/{ROCIS}). All two-electron integrals of Kohn?Sham orbitals that appear in the Hamiltonian matrix are reduced by a total of three scaling parameters that are suitable for a wide range of molecules. Test calculations on open-shell organic radicals as well as transition metal complexes demonstrate the wide applicability of the method and its ability to calculate the electronic spectra of large molecular systems.},

	abstract = {We present a first-principles study on the ground and excited electronic states of a carotenoid-porphyrin-C60 molecular triad. In addition, we illustrate a method for using {DFT}-based wave functions and densities to simulate complicated charge-transfer dynamics. Since fast and efficient calculations of charge-transfer excitations are required to understand these systems, we introduce a simple {DFT}-based method for calculating total energy differences between ground and excited states. To justify the procedure, we argue that some charge-transfer excitations are asympototically ground-state properties of the separated systems. Further justification is provided from numerical experiments on separated alkali atoms. The donor-chromophore-acceptor system studied here can absorb and store light energy for several hundreds of nanoseconds. Our density-functional calculations show that the triad can possess a dipole moment of 171 D in a charge-separated state. The charge-transfer energy technique is used to obtain the energies of the excited states. The charge separated excited states with a large dipole moment will create large polarization of the solvent. We use a model to estimate the stabilization of the excited-state energies in the presence of polarization. The calculated excited-state energies are further used to calculate the Einstein?s A and B coefficients for this molecular system. We use these transition rates in a kinetic Monte-Carlo simulation to examine the electronic excitations and possible charging of the molecule. Our calculations show that the solvent polarization plays a crucial role in reordering the excited-state energies and thereby in the charge-separation process.},

Both quadrupole and dipole contributions to the spectra have been calculated. We find that good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained by using the {BP}86 functional with the {CP}({PPP}) basis set on the Fe and {TZVP} one of the remaining atoms. Inclusion of solvation yields a small improvement in the calculated energies. However, the inclusion of scalar relativistic effects did not yield any improved correlation with experiment.

	abstract = {We explore the utility of density-functional theory ({DFT}) in conjunction with the transition-potential ({TP}) method to simulate x-ray-absorption spectra. Calculations on a set of small carbon-containing molecules and chemisorbed species show that this provides a viable option for obtaining excitation energies and oscillator strengths close to the experimental accuracy of core-valence transitions. Systematic variations in energy positions and intensities of the different spectra in the test series have been investigated, and comparison is made with respect to the static exchange-, self-consistent-field, and explicit electron-correlation methods. The choice between standard exchange-correlation functionals is shown to be of little consequence for the valence resonant, here π*, parts of the x-ray-absorption spectra, while the long-range behavior of presently available functionals is found not to be completely satisfactory for Rydberg-like transitions. Implementing a basis set augmentation technique, one finds that {DFT} methods still account well for most of the salient features in the near-edge x-ray-absorption spectra, save for the multielectron transitions in the near continuum, and for some loss of Rydberg structure. For clusters modeling surface adsorbates, the {DFT} transition potential method reproduces well the spectral compression and intensity reduction for the valence level absorption compared to the free phase, provided fairly large clusters are taken into account. While for near-edge x-ray-absorption fine-structure ({NEXAFS}) spectra of free molecules the {DFT}-{TP} and Hartree-Fock/static exchange methods have complementary advantages, the {DFT}-{TP} method is clearly to be preferred when using clusters to simulate {NEXAFS} spectra of surface adsorbates.},

The static exchange matrices are determined directly from one- and two-electron integrals computed in the atomic orbital basis. Expensive storing and retrieving of integrals is thereby avoided and applications on large species possible. As a demonstration we calculate the discrete and continuum near-edge X-ray absorption spectra for molecules in the n-alkylnitrile sequence {CH}3({CH}2){nCN}.},

By using the appropriate portions of Hartree-Fock exchange for core and valence regions separately, {CV}-B3LYP overcomes the disadvantages of {BHHLYP} and B3LYP, which give inferior descriptions of valence and core excitations, respectively. Density functional theory({DFT}) calculations with the {CV}-B3LYP functional reproduce core- and valence-orbital energies close to those of {BHHLYP} and B3LYP, respectively.

Intermediate neglect of differential overlap (spectroscopic) ({INDO}/S) calculations within the equivalent cores approximation were used to calculate (1s−1, π*) singlet–triplet splittings. The calculated values are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values for the hydrocarbon species but are significantly underestimated for {CO}. A strong correlation between singlet–triplet splittings and oscillator strengths for the 1s → π* transitions was noted and rationalized in terms of the dependence of both factors on the spatial overlap of 1s and π* wave functions., Les états triplets (C 1s−1,π*) du monoxyde de carbone, du benzène, de l'éthylène ont été étudiés par spectroscopie de perte d'énergie des électrons, avec une énergie d'excitation voisine du seuil. La séparation singulet–triplet pour let états (C 1s−1,π*) des hydrocarbures a été mesurée pour la première fois. Le calcul de ces séparations a été effectué par la méthode {INDO}/S (Intermediate neglect of differential overlap/spectroscopic), à l'approximation des coeurs équivalents. Les valeurs calculées sont raisonnablement en accord avec les valeurs expérimentales pour les hydrocarbures, mais elles sont nettement trop basses dans le cas de {CO}. On a noté une forte corrélation entre les séparations singulet–triplet et les forces d'oscillation pour les transitions 1s → π*, ce qui peut s'expliquer par le fait que les deux facteurs dépendent de la superposition spatiale des fonctions d'ondes 1s et π*.

	abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Almlöf, Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations ({ANOs}) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects i f the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (s p) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations i f the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the {ANO} sets of Almlöf and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of c o r r e l a t i o n c o n s i s t e n t b a s i s s e t s, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99\% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding {ANO} sets, even though the latter contains 50\% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94\%–97\% of the total ({HF}+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

	abstract = {Recently, we have proposed an efficient method in the Kohn?Sham density functional theory ({DFT}) to study systems with a constraint on their density (Phys. Rev. A 2005, 72, 24502). In our approach, the constrained state is calculated directly by running a fast optimization of the constraining potential at each iteration of the usual self-consistent-field procedure. Here, we show that the same constrained {DFT} approach applies to systems with multiple constraints on the density. To illustrate the utility of this approach, we focus on the study of long-range charge-transfer ({CT}) states. We show that constrained {DFT} is size-consistent:? one obtains the correct long-range {CT} energy when the donor?acceptor separation distance goes to infinity. For large finite distances, constrained {DFT} also correctly describes the 1/R dependence of the {CT} energy on the donor?acceptor separation. We also study a model donor?(amidinium?carboxylate)?acceptor complex, where experiments suggest a proton-coupled electron-transfer process. Constrained {DFT} is used to explicitly calculate the potential-energy curves of both the donor state and the acceptor state. With an appropriate model, we obtain qualitative agreement with experiments and estimate the reaction barrier height to be 7 kcal/mol.},

	abstract = {We discuss our implementation and application of time-dependent density functional theory ({TDDFT}) to core-level near-edge absorption spectroscopy, using both linear-response ({LR}) and real-time ({RT}) approaches. We briefly describe our restricted excitation window {TDDFT} ({REW}-{TDDFT}) approach for core excitations, which has also been reported by other groups. This is followed by a detailed discussion of real-time {TDDFT} techniques tailored to core excitations, including obtaining spectral information through delta-function excitation, postprocessing time-dependent signals, and resonant excitation through quasi-monochromatic excitation. We present results for the oxygen K-edge of water and carbon monoxide; the carbon K-edge of carbon monoxide; the ruthenium L3-edge for the hexaamminerutheium({III}) ion, including scalar relativistic corrections via the zeroth order regular approximation ({ZORA}); and the carbon and fluorine K-edges for a series of fluorobenzenes. In all cases, the calculated spectra are found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental results, requiring only a uniform shift ranging from ?4 {eV} to +19 {eV}, i.e., on the order of a few percent of the excitation energy. Real-time {TDDFT} visualization of excited state charge densities is used to visually examine the nature of each excitation, which gives insight into the effects of atoms bound to the absorbing center.},

The {OMP}2 method is applied to difficult chemical systems, including those where spatial or spin symmetry-breaking instabilities are observed. The performance of the {OMP}2 method is compared with that of second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory ({MP}2) for investigating geometries and vibrational frequencies of the cis-{HOOH}+, trans-{HOOH}+, {LiO}2, C 3 + , and {NO}2 molecules. For harmonic vibrational frequencies, the {OMP}2 method eliminates the singularities arising from the abnormal response contributions observed for {MP}2 in case of symmetry-breaking problems, and provides significantly improved vibrational frequencies for the above molecules. We also consider the hydrogen transfer reactions between several free radicals, for which {MP}2 provides poor reaction energies. The {OMP}2 method again exhibits a considerably better performance than {MP}2, providing a mean absolute error of 2.3 kcal mol−1, which is more than 5 times lower than that of {MP}2 (13.2 kcal mol−1). Overall, the {OMP}2 method seems quite helpful for electronically challenging chemical systems such as symmetry-breaking molecules, hydrogen transfer reactions, or other cases where standard {MP}2 proves unreliable. For such systems, we recommend using {OMP}2 instead of {MP}2 as a more robust method with the same computational scaling.},

	abstract = {The correlation‐consistent polarized valence basis sets (cc‐{pVXZ}) for the atoms boron through neon have been extended to treat core and core‐valence correlation effects. Basis functions were added to the existing cc‐{pVXZ} sets to form correlation‐consistent polarized core‐valence sets (cc‐{pCVXZ}) in the usual pattern: Double zeta added (1s1p), triple zeta added (2s2p1d), quadruple zeta added (3s3p2d1f), and quintuple zeta added (4s4p3d2f1g). The exponents of the core functions were determined by minimizing the difference between all‐electron and valence‐only correlation energies obtained from {HF}+1+2 calculations on the ground states of the atoms. With the cc‐{pCVXZ} sets, core, core‐valence, and valence correlation energies all converge exponentially toward apparent complete basis set ({CBS}) limits, as do the corresponding all‐electron singles and doubles {CI} energies. Several test applications of the new sets are presented: The first two ionization potentials of boron, the 3 P–5 S separation in carbon, and the X̃ 3 B 1–ã 1 A 1 state separation in {CH}2. As expected, correlation effects involving the core electrons of the first row atoms, B–Ne, are small but must be included if high accuracy is required.},

We show that the {LC} scheme completely fails to improve the poor accuracy of conventional generalized gradient approximation functionals, while the {LCgau} scheme gives an accuracy which is an order of magnitude better than {BLYP} and significantly better than B3LYP. A reoptimization of the two parameters controlling the inclusion of short-range {HF} exchange in the {LCgau} method enables the errors to be reduced to the order of 0.1 {eV} which is competitive with the best {DFT} methods we are aware of. This reparametrization does not affect the {LC} scheme and therefore maintains the high accuracy of predicted reaction barrier heights. Moreover, while there is some loss in accuracy in thermochemical predictions compared to the previously optimized {LCgau}-{BOP}, rms errors in the atomization energies over the G2 test set are found to be comparable to B3LYP. Finally, we attempt to rationalize the success of the {LC} and {LCgau} schemes in terms of the well-known self-interaction error ({SIE}) of conventional functionals. To estimate the role of the {SIE}, we examine the total energy calculations for systems with a fractional number of electrons, not only in the highest occupied molecular orbital but also in the 1 s -characterized core orbital. Our conclusion is that the inclusion of short-range {HF} exchange in {LC}-type functionals can significantly alleviate the problems of the {SIE} in the core region. In particular, we confirm that the absence of the {SIE} diagnostics in the core orbital energies correlates with the accurate prediction of core-excitation energies using the newly optimized {LCgau} approach.},

The electronic structure of 1 is further related to the oxidized Cu site in plastocyanin. The key spectral differences relative to plastocyanin include an increase in the intensity of the S pπ ? Cu {CT} band and a decrease in the absorption intensity at ?450 nm. The energies of d ? d transitions in 1 decrease relative to plastocyanin, which reflects the more tetrahedral geometry of 1. S K-edge {XAS} measurements demonstrate a more covalent thiolate interaction in the {HOMO} of 1 (52\% S p) than in plastocyanin (38\% S p). The effects of the high thiolate covalency on the absorption and Raman spectral features for 1 are evaluated. Additional changes in the absorption spectrum of 1 relative to plastocyanin in the ?450 nm and the near-infrared regions are due to differences in the electronic structure of the nitrogen ligands associated with the change from imidazole to pyrazole. Finally, {XAS} measurements at the Cu L- and K-edges indicate that the effective nuclear charge of Cu in 1 is higher than in plastocyanin, which likely results from misdirection of the ligating orbitals in the constrained tris(pyrazolyl)hydroborate ligand system. This reduces the donor interaction of this ligand with the copper which increases the covalency of the thiolate?Cu bond and can contribute to the electron-transfer properties of the blue copper site.},

The 3σu* valence state is observed in the 3sσg Rydberg region with no mixing. The 3pσu state is found in the same region as the C1sσg→3pπu state, which shows only totally symmetric vibrations. This is the first to observe that the Rydberg state in C2H2 keeps gerade and ungerade symmetries without vibronic coupling through antisymmetric stretching vibrations related to core–hole localization. On the other hand, the lowest 1πg* valence state induces vibronic coupling through bending vibrations in the 3σu* and 3sσg states.},

Calibration was carried out for 55 molecules and 114 binding energies of 1s core electrons for the atoms C, N, O, and F. The average absolute deviation for all the core electron binding energies is 0.163 {eV}.

The assessment of conventional exchange-correlation functionals shows that the appropriate portions of Hartree?Fock ({HF}) exchange for core-excited-state calculations depend on shells:? 70\% and 50\% for K-shell and L-shell excitations, respectively. Therefore, the modified {CVR}-B3LYP functional is designed to use the appropriate portions of {HF} exchange, 70\%, 50\%, and 20\%, for K-shell, L-shell, and valence regions separately. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations with the modified {CVR}-B3LYP functional yield both K-shell and L-shell excitation energies with reasonable accuracy. The modified {CVR}-B3LYP also provides valence-excitation energies and standard enthalpies of formation accurately. Thus, the modified {CVR}-B3LYP describes all of the K-shell, L-shell, and valence electrons appropriately.},

The method is compared with recently developed Bethe-Salpeter approach. The method is applied to the carbon K edge in diamond and to the silicon and oxygen K edges in α-quartz for which polarized {XANES} spectra were measured.

The x-rayabsorption ({XA}) spectra are generated using the transition potential technique with the effect of the core hole included through a specifically developed pseudopotential for the core-excited atom. Despite the lack of 1s core orbitals in the pseudopotential treatment, the required transition moments are accurately calculated without reconstruction of the all-electron orbitals. The method is applied to the oxygen {XA} spectra of water in its various aggregation states, but it is transferable to any first-row element. The computed spectra are compared favorably with the results from all-electron cluster calculations, as well as with experimental data. The periodicity of the plane-wave technique improves the description of condensed phases. The molecular dynamics simulation enables in principle a proper treatment of thermal effects and dynamical averaging in complex systems.},

Cytosine exhibited characteristic asymmetric and symmetric {NH}2 stretching signal. The asymmetric stretching signal was missing in the submonolayer region, indicating that the whole molecule was standing upright, with the {NH}2 group sticking out of the surface. Thymine was also proved to stand upright at surface. Guanine exhibited weakened infrared signals, indicating that the core purine ring was tilted on the surface, with an interaction of {NH}CO side of the molecule. Adenine at coverages below one monolayer gave no absorption signals, evidencing the molecules laid flat along the surface.

	abstract = {A practical polarization propagator method devised for the treatment of valence electron excitations in atoms and molecules is presented. This method, referred to as (second-order) algebraic-diagrammatic construction ({ADC}(2)), allows for a theoretical description of single and double excitations consistently through second and first order, respectively, of perturbation theory. The computational scheme is essentially an eigenvalue problem of a Hermitian secular matrix defined with respect to the space of singly and doubly excited configurations. The configuration space is smaller (more compact) than that of comparable configuration interaction ({CI}) expansions and the method leads to size-consistent results. The performance of the {ADC}(2) method is tested in exemplary applications to Ne, Ar and {CO}, where detailed comparison can be made with experiment and previous theoretical results. While the accuracy of the absolute excitation energies is only moderate, a very satisfactory description is obtained for the relative energies and, in particular, for the spectral intensities. Aspects related to the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule and the equivalence of the dipole-length and dipole-velocity forms of the transition moments are discussed. Due to the relatively small computational expense and the possibility of a direct {ADC}(2) formulation this method should prove particularly useful in applications to large molecules.},

	abstract = {For chemically accurate excited state energies, one is forced to include electron?electron correlation at a level of theory significantly higher than configuration interaction singles ({CIS}). Post-{CIS} corrections do exist, but most often, if they are computationally inexpensive, these methods rely on perturbation theory. At the same time, inexpensive variational post-{CIS} methods would be ideal since modeling electronic relaxation usually requires globally smooth potential energy surfaces ({PESs}) and there will inevitably be regions of near electronic degeneracy. With that goal in mind, we now present a new method entitled variationally orbital adapted {CIS} ({VOA}-{CIS}). On the one hand, we show that in the ground-state geometry, {VOA}-{CIS} performs comparably to {CIS}(D) at predicting relative excited state energies. On the other hand, far beyond {CIS}(D) or any other perturbative method, {VOA}-{CIS} correctly rebalances the energy of charge-transfer ({CT}) states versus non-{CT} states, while simultaneously producing smooth {PESs}?including the important case of avoided crossings. In fact, through localized diabatization of {VOA}-{CIS} excited states, one can find a set of reasonable diabatic states modeling {CT} chemical dynamics. After significant benchmarking, we are now confident {VOA}-{CIS} and {VOA}-{CIS}-like methods should play a major role in future excited state calculations.},

	abstract = {The electronic environment of nitrogen in nucleic acid bases, nucleotides, polynucleotides and {DNA} has been studied, for the first time using X-Ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy ({XANES}). Generally, the spectra of these complex molecules consist of low energy bands corresponding to 1s → π∗ transitions and high energy bands corresponding to 1s → σ∗ transition, as illustrated using several nitrogen model compounds. The 1s → π∗ transitions show particular sensitivity to the chemical environment of the nitrogen. Oxygen substitution on ring carbon atoms generally results in a significant blue shift of the lowest 1s → π∗ bands while halogen substitution results in a small blue shift. These observations illustrate the significance of the disturbance of the aromatic ring system produced by exocyclic carbonyl groups. Direct substitution on the nitrogen frequently results in significant spectral perturbations. Differences between the spectra of the polynucleotides and the sums of spectra of the individual nucleotides point to the effects of hydrogen-bonding in complementary double-helix structures. The {XANES} spectrum of a {DNA} sample with a known ratio of the polynucleotides is equivalent to the weighted sum of the spectra of individual polynucleotides, indicating that the difference in base stacking interactions produces negligible spectral effects. The variability of nitrogen K-edge spectra in these samples and in protein may be useful for chemically specific imaging using X-ray microscopes.},

These auxiliary bases are slightly more than three times larger than orbital bases of split valence quality. Compared to non-approximated treatments, computation times for the Coulomb part are reduced by a factor of ca. 8 for def2-{SV}(P) orbital bases, ca. 25 for def2-{TZVP} and ca. 100 for def2-{QZVPP} orbital bases.},

Also, the correct 1/R asymptotic behavior of {CT} states with respect to a distance coordinate R between the separated charges of the {CT} state is not reproduced by {TDDFT} employing these xc-functionals. Here, we demonstrate by analysis of the {TDDFT} equations that the first failure is due to the self-interaction error in the orbital energies from the ground-state {DFT} calculation, while the latter is a similar self-interaction error in {TDDFT} arising through the electron transfer in the {CT} state. Possible correction schemes, such as inclusion of exact Hartree?Fock or exact Kohn?Sham exchange, as well as aspects of the exact xc-functional are discussed in this context. Furthermore, a practical approach is proposed which combines the benefits of {TDDFT} and configuration interaction singles ({CIS}) and which does not suffer from electron-transfer self-interaction. The latter approach is applied to a (1,4)-phenylene-linked zincbacteriochlorin?bacteriochlorin complex and to a bacteriochlorophyll?spheroidene complex, in which {CT} states may play important roles in energy and electron-transfer processes. The errors of {TDDFT} alone for the {CT} states are demonstrated, and reasonable estimates for the true excitation energies of these states are given.},

	abstract = {A theoretical study of the relationship between interatomic distances and the spectral positions of valence‐ and K‐shell σ* photoionization resonances is reported for a selected series of molecules. Three‐dimensional graphical representations of the occupied and virtual‐valence σ‐symmetry orbitals of these compounds reveal their striking similarity to the wave functions of a particle in a cylindrical well, substantiating qualitative notions long employed in free‐electron molecular orbital ({FEMO}) approximations. Accordingly, the molecular potential along the symmetry axis in these compounds is modeled after a finite square well, with a depth approximately equal to the energy of the lowest σ‐symmetry valence molecular orbital and a width determined from analogies to {FEMO} theory. Calculated minimal‐basis‐set molecular‐orbital energies for both occupied and virtual states are seen to correlate accurately with the simple square‐well energy level formula (π2 /2)(n 2/l 2 ) when measured in Hartree atomic units from the bottom of the well. The calculated σ* orbital energies are furthermore in excellent agreement with experimentally and theoretically determined valence‐shell photoionization resonance positions, the latter consequently also satisfying the square‐well correlation formula. A similar situation obtains for experimentally and theoretically determined K‐shell resonance positions, although energy shifts from minimal‐basis values are evident in these cases. These circumstances are clarified quantitatively on basis of Feshbach–Fano considerations, in which minimal‐basis‐set virtual‐valence σ* orbitals play the roles of zeroth‐order states subject to modification by interactions with nonresonant background continua. Concluding remarks contrast and compare molecular‐orbital and square‐well approaches to photoionization resonances with those based on multiple‐scattering and barrier models. The present results appear to clarify the origins of recently reported empirical correlations of bond lengths with resonance positions, and help to determine their range of applicability.},

Therefore, the modified {CVR}-B3LYP functional is designed to use the appropriate portions of {HF} exchange, 70\%, 50\%, and 20\%, for K-shell, L-shell, and valence regions separately. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations with the modified {CVR}-B3LYP functional yield both K-shell and L-shell excitation energies with reasonable accuracy. The modified {CVR}-B3LYP also provides valence-excitation energies and standard enthalpies of formation accurately.

	abstract = {Hybrid functionals are responsible for much of the utility of modern Kohn-Sham density functional theory. When rigorously applied to solid-state metallic and small band gap systems, however, the slow decay of their nonlocal Hartree-Fock-type exchange makes hybrids computationally challenging and introduces unphysical effects. This can be remedied by using a range-separated hybrid which only keeps short-range nonlocal exchange, as in the functional of Heyd et al. [J. Chem. Phys.118, 8207 (2003)]. On the other hand, many molecular properties require full long-range nonlocal exchange, which can also be included by means of a range-separated hybrid such as the recently introduced {LC} - ω {PBE} functional [O. A. Vydrov and G. E. Scuseria, J. Chem. Phys.125, 234109 (2006)]. In this paper, we show that a three-range hybrid which mainly includes middle-range Hartree-Fock-type exchange and neglects long- and short-range Hartree-Fock-type exchange yields excellent accuracy for thermochemistry, barrier heights, and band gaps, emphasizing that the middle-range part of the 1 ∕ r potential seems crucial to accurately model these properties.},

The intensity of the coherent {SR} was about 105 times as strong as that of incoherent {SR} in the wavelengths of 0.4–2.2 mm. This enhancement factor corresponds to the number of electrons in a bunch. The {SR} intensity showed a quadratic dependence on the electron beam current. The radiation was mainly polarized in the orbital plane. The possibility of induced rf in a vacuum chamber was excluded experimentally.},

	abstract = {The theoretical description of core‐excitation spectra presents a difficult problem due to the large excitation energies involved, and the extensive relaxation effects that occur upon promotion of a core electron to a valence or Rydberg level. For this reason we follow a two‐step procedure to evaluate core‐excitation energies. We start from a coupled cluster singles‐doubles ({CCSD}) description of the core ion to include the large relaxation effects, followed by adding an extra electron to the core‐ionized state to obtain the various core‐excited states of the neutral by using the open‐shell electron attachment equation‐of‐motion coupled cluster method ({EA}‐{EOMCC}). An important feature of the approach is that the term values, the core‐excitation energies relative to the relevant core‐ionization potential, are calculated directly and this allows us to achieve high accuracy. This work describes the extension of the {EA}‐{EOMCC} method to open‐shell reference states and we make applications to a number of molecular systems. The assignment of recently obtained high‐resolution core‐excitation spectra for acetylene and ethylene is discussed, and we compare our open‐shell {EA}‐{EOMCC} results to results obtained from closed‐shell {EA}‐{EOMCC} calculations based on the equivalent core ion corresponding to the core‐excited molecular system. Special attention is paid to the singlet–triplet splitting for core‐excited states, and we address the multireference character of core‐ionized and core‐excited states for molecules that contain symmetry‐equivalent heavy nuclei, which relates to a persistent controversy in the literature concerning localized versus delocalized core holes.},

The excited state density functional is recast as a Kohn?Sham functional, which is further simplified by an adiabatic approximation of the exchange-correlation functional. Under the adiabatic approximation, the minimization of the excited state Kohn?Sham functional is shown to be equivalent to a ground state {DFT} computation augmented with orthogonality constraints with respect to the ground state Kohn?Sham determinant. An algorithm for the optimization of the energy subject to orthogonality constraints, which does not suffer from variational collapse, is described and implemented. A benchmark test set containing 28 organic molecules ( Schreiber, M. J. Chem. Phys. 2008, 128, 134110 ) was used to assess the quality of the excitation energies obtained. Two novel approaches to spin-adapt the resulting excitation energies are discussed and found to provide results with error metrics similar to those of time-dependent {DFT}. Similarities and differences with respect to other time-independent {DFT} approaches are highlighted and some of the advantages of our scheme?including the ability to correctly describe charge-transfer excitations?are critically assessed.},

In contrast to these expectations, we demonstrate that oxygen in nucleobases adsorbed on graphene with π-π stacking interaction can clearly alter the electric current even in water at room temperature.

The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree–Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems. The high accuracy of the new screened Coulomb potential hybrid, combined with its computational advantages, makes it widely applicable to large molecules and periodic systems.},

	abstract = {The x-ray-absorption near-edge structure of gas-phase H2S, hydrogen sulfide, and D2S, deuterium sulfide, at the sulfur L2,3 ionization thresholds has been measured using synchrotron radiation with high-energy resolution from the {SX}700/{II} soft-x-ray monochromator at the Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gessellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung m.b.H. Previously unobserved fine structure is resolved. The spectra of both molecules are characterized by multielectron excitations 8–14 {eV} above the L2 threshold energy, broad valence-shell absorption features 5–8 {eV} below the L2 edge, and many narrower Rydberg excitations 0–5 {eV} below the L2 edge. Comparison of the H2S and D2S spectra allows the identification of transitions which include vibrational excitation, due to the isotopic dependence of vibrational energies. For the (2p)-1 core-excited Rydberg states, a least-squares analysis was employed, which deconvoluted the core-level and excited-orbital splittings. Results show that the twofold degeneracy of the sulfur 2p3/2 core level is removed by the molecular field, with a resulting splitting of 115 {meV} for the higher-energy core-excited Rydberg states. The energies of the higher Rydberg states were well described by the Rydberg formula with the quantum defects δp=1.63 and δd=0.32. Fine structure was resolved in the transitions to the dissociative (2p)-1 core-excited valence-shell states. The regular spacing and isotopic dependence of this structure clearly identifies it as a vibrational progression.},

In this work, it is examined for use in computing electronic excited states, for the challenging case of conical intersections. Conical intersections are a prevalent feature of excited electronic surfaces, but conventional time-dependent density functional theory calculations are found to be entirely unsatisfactory at describing them, for two small systems. {CDFT}-{CI} calculations on those systems are found to be in qualitative agreement with reference {CAS} surfaces. These results suggest that with a suitable definition of atomic populations and a careful choice of constrained states, {CDFT}-{CI} could be the basis for a seamless description of electronic degeneracy.},

	abstract = {In this work we highlight the potential of {NEXAFS}?near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure?analysis to perform refinements of hydrogen-bond structure in {DNA}. For this purpose we have carried out first-principle calculations of the N1s {NEXAFS} spectra of the guanine and cytosine nucleobases and their tautomers, nucleosides, and nucleotides in the gas phase, as well as for five crystal structures of guanine, cytosine, or guanosine. The spectra all clearly show imine (π1*) and amine (π2*) nitrogen absorption bands with a characteristic energy difference (?). Among all of the intramolecule covalent connections, the tautomerism of hydrogens makes the largest influence, around ±0.4?0.5 {eV} change of ?, to the spectra due to a switch of single?double bonds. Deoxyribose and ribose sugars can cause at most 0.2 {eV} narrowing of ?, while the phosphate groups have nearly negligible effects on the spectra. Two kinds of intermolecule interactions are analyzed, the hydrogen bonds and the stacking effect, by comparing ?compressed? and ?expanded? models or by comparing models including or excluding the nearest stacking molecules. The shortening of hydrogen-bond length by 0.2?0.3 Å can result in the reduction of ? by 0.2?0.8 {eV}. This is because the hydrogen bonds make the electrons more delocalized, and the amine and imine nitrogens become less distinguishable. Moreover, the hydrogen bond has a different ability to influence the spectra of different crystals, with guanine crystals as the largest (change by 0.8 {eV}) and the guanosine crystal as the smallest (change by 0.2 {eV}). The stacking has negligible effects on the spectra in all studied systems. A comparison of guanosine to guanine crystals shows that the sugars in the crystal could create ?blocks? in the π-and hydrogen bonds network of bases and thus makes the imine and amine nitrogens more distinguishable with a larger ?. Our theoretical calculations offer a good match with experimental findings and explain earlier discrepancies in the {NEXAFS} analysis.},

The conformation of the molecule in the crystalline state is determined by the formal charge distribution within the molecule which exists as a zwitterion with the negative pyrophosphate chain folded back over the positive, ring portion of the molecule. The oxygen atoms in the pyrophosphate group are in the staggered conformation when viewed along the phosphorus-phosphorus axis. Even though the pyrophosphate is present in this compound as the monoionized monoester, the configuration is the same as that present in the inorganic pyrophosphate ion. From a comparison of three different crystal structures containing the thiamine moiety and from studies with atomic models, it seems plausible that the basic molecular conformation observed in this crystal is maintained in the catalytically active molecule. Knowledge of the detailed crystal structure provides new insight into the biochemical mechanism of reactions catalyzed by thiamine pyrophosphate.},
