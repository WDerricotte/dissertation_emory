	abstract = {Psi4 is an ab initio electronic structure program providing methods such as Hartree–Fock, density functional theory, configuration interaction, and coupled-cluster theory. The 1.1 release represents a major update meant to automate complex tasks, such as geometry optimization using complete-basis-set extrapolation or focal-point methods. Conversion of the top-level code to a Python module means that Psi4 can now be used in complex workflows alongside other Python tools. Several new features have been added with the aid of libraries providing easy access to techniques such as density fitting, Cholesky decomposition, and Laplace denominators. The build system has been completely rewritten to simplify interoperability with independent, reusable software components for quantum chemistry. Finally, a wide range of new theoretical methods and analyses have been added to the code base, including functional-group and open-shell symmetry adapted perturbation theory (F-SAPT and O-SAPT), density-fitted coupled cluster with frozen natural orbitals [DF-FNO-CCSD(T)], orbital-optimized perturbation and coupled-cluster methods (e.g., OO-MP2 and OO-CCSD), density-fitted multiconfigurational self-consistent field (DF-MCSCF), density cumulant functional theory (DCT), algebraic-diagrammatic construction [ADC(2)] excited states, improvements to the geometry optimizer, and the "X2C" approach to relativistic corrections, among many other improvements.},

The local structure is characterized by comparison with bulk and surface of ordinary hexagonal ice Ih and with calculated spectra. Most molecules in liquid water are in two hydrogen–bonded configurations with one strong donor and one strong acceptor hydrogen bond in contrast to the four hydrogen–bonded tetrahedral structure in ice. Upon heating from 25°C to 90°C, 5 to 10\% of the molecules change from tetrahedral environments to two hydrogen–bonded configurations. Our findings are consistent with neutron and x-ray diffraction data, and combining the results sets a strong limit for possible local structure distributions in liquid water. Serious discrepancies with structures based on current molecular dynamics simulations are observed.},

The compounds investigated can be divided into two groups concerning the order of the multiphonon relaxation: 6–7 and 4–5 phonons. Besides the well-known dependence on the number of phonons involved in the radiationless transition, the multiphonon relaxation rates are observed to be greatly enhanced by increasing covalency and/or decreasing Pr-ligand distances. The enhanced multiphonon relaxation is ascribed to a stronger electron-phonon coupling. The increase in the electron-phonon coupling strength is confirmed by the increase of the vibronic transition probabilities AVIB in the same sequence as the ANR rates. The observed host lattice dependence of ANR can be qualitatively accounted for by a nonlinear multiphonon relaxation mechanism. Under certain conditions (viz. low-lying 4f 5d states, and a force constant stronger in the 4f 5d state than in the 4f2 states) fast 3P0 → 1D2 non-radiative relaxation via the 4f 5d state becomes the dominant relaxation mechanism, even at 4.2 K.},

Analysis of the data over the temperature range 251 to 288 kelvin (–22° to +15°C) yields a value of 1.5 ± 0.5 kilocalories per mole for the average thermal energy required to effect an observable rearrangement between the fully coordinated (“ice-like”) and distorted (“broken-donor”) local hydrogen-bonding configurations responsible for the pre-edge and post-edge features, respectively. This energy equals the latent heat of melting of ice with hexagonal symmetry (ice Ih) and is consistent with the distribution of hydrogen bond strengths obtained for the “overstructured” ST2 model of water.

The energy-transfer and light-emission mechanisms were studied in the Ir(ppy)3-doped Alq3 thin films. The triplet energy of Alq3 was determined to be 2.03eV from the highest-energy peak of the phosphorescence spectra, and the phosphorescence lifetime was 5.3ms at 8K. The phosphorescence lifetime and intensity significantly decreased with an increase in temperature, especially at temperatures above 100K. From this study, we have found that the triplet energy transfer from Ir(ppy)3 enables us to characterize the phosphorescence properties of Alq3, and that Ir(ppy)3 plays the important role of a phosphorescent sensitizer for Alq3.},

	abstract = {We report a novel scheme for computing electronic excitation energies within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) based on a time-independent variational formulation of DFT. The excited state density functional is recast as a Kohn–Sham functional, which is further simplified by an adiabatic approximation of the exchange-correlation functional. Under the adiabatic approximation, the minimization of the excited state Kohn–Sham functional is shown to be equivalent to a ground state DFT computation augmented with orthogonality constraints with respect to the ground state Kohn–Sham determinant. An algorithm for the optimization of the energy subject to orthogonality constraints, which does not suffer from variational collapse, is described and implemented. A benchmark test set containing 28 organic molecules (Schreiber, M. J. Chem. Phys. 2008, 128, 134110) was used to assess the quality of the excitation energies obtained. Two novel approaches to spin-adapt the resulting excitation energies are discussed and found to provide results with error metrics similar to those of time-dependent DFT. Similarities and differences with respect to other time-independent DFT approaches are highlighted and some of the advantages of our scheme—including the ability to correctly describe charge-transfer excitations—are critically assessed.},

	abstract = {We present a class of methods for extracting a polarized atomic orbital (EPAO) minimal basis set from a converged molecular orbital (MO) calculation. Unlike minimal basis sets obtained from previous approaches, EPAOs rigorously contain the occupied molecular orbital space. EPAOs achieve this exactness because their spatial extent is not restricted. Nonetheless, EPAOs are optimally localized with respect to a localization criterion and are essentially single-centered. EPAOs provide an alternative scheme for partitioning the electron density into atomic subspaces. Therefore, they can be used to determine atomic and chemical group properties such as charge populations. Since EPAOs provide a compact description to the occupied space, they may have other computational applications such as in local correlation methods. Additionally, the EPAOs give a description of valence antibonding orbitals that may be appropriate for nondynamical electron correlation. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Finally, the so-called “compensation effect” is also treated in some detail, citing a critical paper which testifies that this effect is an artefact; it simply reflects the relation between the Gibbs function, the enthalpy, and the entropy.},

	abstract = {Many chemical concepts hinge on the notion of an orbital called the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, or LUMO. This hypothetical orbital and the much more concrete highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) constitute the two “frontier orbitals”, which rationalize a great deal of chemistry. A viable LUMO candidate should have a sensible energy value, a realistic shape with amplitude on those atoms where electron attachment or reduction or excitation processes occur, and often an antibonding correspondence to one of the highest occupied MOs. Unfortunately, today’s quantum chemistry calculations do not yield useful empty orbitals. Instead, the empty canonical orbitals form a large sea of orbitals, where the interesting valence antibonds are scrambled with the basis set’s polarization and diffuse augmentations. The LUMO is thus lost within a continuum associated with a detached electron, as well as many Rydberg excited states. A suitable alternative to the canonical orbitals is proposed, namely, the valence virtual orbitals. VVOs are found by a simple algorithm based on singular value decomposition, which allows for the extraction of all valence-like orbitals from the large empty canonical orbital space. VVOs are found to be nearly independent of the working basis set. The utility of VVOs is demonstrated for construction of qualitative MO diagrams, for prediction of valence excited states, and as starting orbitals for more sophisticated calculations. This suggests that VVOs are a suitable realization of the LUMO, LUMO + 1, ... concept. VVO generation requires no expert knowledge, as the number of VVOs sought is found by counting s-block atoms as having only a valence s orbital, transition metals as having valence s and d, and main group atoms as being valence s and p elements. Closed shell, open shell, or multireference wave functions and elements up to xenon may be used in the present program.},

	abstract = {It is well-known that time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) yields substantial errors for the excitation energies of charge-transfer (CT) excited states, when approximate standard exchange-correlation (xc) functionals are used, for example, SVWN, BLYP, or B3LYP. Also, the correct 1/R asymptotic behavior of CT states with respect to a distance coordinate R between the separated charges of the CT state is not reproduced by TDDFT employing these xc-functionals. Here, we demonstrate by analysis of the TDDFT equations that the first failure is due to the self-interaction error in the orbital energies from the ground-state DFT calculation, while the latter is a similar self-interaction error in TDDFT arising through the electron transfer in the CT state. Possible correction schemes, such as inclusion of exact Hartree−Fock or exact Kohn−Sham exchange, as well as aspects of the exact xc-functional are discussed in this context. Furthermore, a practical approach is proposed which combines the benefits of TDDFT and configuration interaction singles (CIS) and which does not suffer from electron-transfer self-interaction. The latter approach is applied to a (1,4)-phenylene-linked zincbacteriochlorin−bacteriochlorin complex and to a bacteriochlorophyll−spheroidene complex, in which CT states may play important roles in energy and electron-transfer processes. The errors of TDDFT alone for the CT states are demonstrated, and reasonable estimates for the true excitation energies of these states are given.},

	abstract = {Hybrid functionals are responsible for much of the utility of modern Kohn-Sham density functional theory. When rigorously applied to solid-state metallic and small band gap systems, however, the slow decay of their nonlocal Hartree-Fock-type exchange makes hybrids computationally challenging and introduces unphysical effects. This can be remedied by using a range-separated hybrid which only keeps short-range nonlocal exchange, as in the functional of Heyd et al. [J. Chem. Phys.118, 8207 (2003)]. On the other hand, many molecular properties require full long-range nonlocal exchange, which can also be included by means of a range-separated hybrid such as the recently introduced LC - ω PBE functional [O. A. Vydrov and G. E. Scuseria, J. Chem. Phys.125, 234109 (2006)]. In this paper, we show that a three-range hybrid which mainly includes middle-range Hartree-Fock-type exchange and neglects long- and short-range Hartree-Fock-type exchange yields excellent accuracy for thermochemistry, barrier heights, and band gaps, emphasizing that the middle-range part of the 1 ∕ r potential seems crucial to accurately model these properties.},

	abstract = {Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are promising dopants for organic light-emitting diodes, including those containing highly twisted donor–acceptor-type structures. However, highly twisted structures limit the variety of chemical structures applicable as TADF emitters. We present a strategy for designing electron donors that can eliminate this requirement and increase the structural diversity of TADF emitters. Using this strategy, we developed an electron donor containing carbazolyl and diphenylamino groups by carefully controlling its electron-donating ability. By combining this donor with a quinoxaline-based acceptor, we obtained the efficient green TADF emitter, N3,N3,N6,N6-tetraphenyl-9-(4-(quinoxalin-6-yl)phenyl)-9H-carbazole-3,6-diamine (DACQ), without a highly twisted structure. DACQ exhibits high photoluminescence and electroluminescence efficiencies, comparable to those of a highly twisted TADF emitter containing the same electron-accepting unit. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the diphenylamino groups within the carbazolyl moiety effectively withdraw the HOMO distribution. This reduces the singlet–triplet energy gap, thus inducing TADF. The photophysical properties of TADF compounds depend on the twisting angle between the electron-donating and accepting units. Eliminating the highly twisted structure increases the diversity of potential TADF emitters and allows their photophysical properties to be controlled by changing the twisting angle.},

In the internal space, oriented quasi-atomic orbitals and split-localized molecular orbitals are determined by new, fast localization methods. The density matrix between the oriented quasi-atomic orbitals as well as the locations of the split-localized orbitals exhibit atomic populations and inter-atomic bonding patterns. A correlation-adapted quasi-atomic basis is determined in the external orbital space. The general formulations are specified in detail for Hartree-Fock wave functions.

Molecules with a propensity for TADF necessarily have two properties: a small gap between the lowest lying singlet and triplet excited states and a large transition dipole moment for fluorescence. In this work, we demonstrate the use of a genetic algorithm to search a region of chemical space for molecules with these properties. This algorithm is based on a flexible and intuitive representation of the molecule as a tree data structure, in which the nodes correspond to molecular fragments. Our implementation takes advantage of hybrid parallel graphics processing unit accelerated computer clusters to allow efficient sampling while retaining a reasonably accurate description of the electronic structure (in this case, CAM-B3LYP/6-31G∗∗). In total, we have identified 3792 promising candidate fluorophores from a chemical space containing 1.26 × 106 molecules. This required performing electronic structure calculations on only 7518 molecules, a small fraction of the full space. Several novel classes of molecules which show promise as fluorophores are presented.},

Triple corrections to the excitation energies can be included via the CCSDR(3) (coupled-cluster singles and doubles with noniterative-triples-corrected excitation energies) approximation. The performance and some of the potentialities of the approach are investigated in calculations of the visible/ultraviolet absorption spectrum and the dispersion of the real polarizability in near-resonant regions of pyrimidine, the near-edge absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) of ammonia, and the direct determination of the C6 dipole–dipole dispersion coefficient of the benzene dimer.},

There are two sides to a self-consistent field calculation: the determination of the potential and the solution of Schr{\"o}dinger's equation for the one-electron problem. The solution of Schr{\"o}dinger's equation has fortunately advanced far enough through the application of the electronic digital computer so that it can be regarded for most purposes as being a standardized technique. The main point of the method of Gaspar, Kohn, and Sham is that they derive the approximate exchange correction from an approximate Hamiltonian for the system by varying the spin-orbitals to minimize the average value of this Hamiltonian for the ground state. The approximate Hamiltonian has many important and valuable features that are described in the chapter.},

	abstract = {A non-iterative algorithm for the localization of molecular orbitals (MOs) from complete active space self consistent field (CASSCF) and for single-determinantal wave functions on predefined moieties is given. The localized fragment orbitals can be used to analyze chemical reactions between fragments and also the binding of fragments in the product molecule with a fragments-in-molecules approach by using a valence bond expansion of the CASSCF wave function. The algorithm is an example of the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which is a matrix optimization problem using the singular value decomposition. It is based on the similarity of the set of MOs for the moieties to the localized MOs of the molecule; the similarity is expressed by overlap matrices between the original fragment MOs and the localized MOs. For CASSCF wave functions, localization is done independently in the space of occupied orbitals and active orbitals, whereas, the space of virtual orbitals is mostly uninteresting. Localization of Hartree–Fock or Kohn–Sham density functional theory orbitals is not straightforward; rather, it needs careful consideration, because in this case some virtual orbitals are needed but the space of virtual orbitals depends on the basis sets used and causes considerable problems due to the diffuse character of most virtual orbitals. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {The photophysics of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in phenothiazine-dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide (PTZ-DBTO2) molecule is investigated in detail. First, it is shown that the proximity of local triplet excited states (3LE), e.g., 3D or 3A, above or below the DA charge transfer states (CT) is crucial for the efficiency of the TADF mechanism in PTZ-DBTO2. This TADF emitter is then used as a monomer unit to design polymer materials with efficient TADF. The reverse intersystem crossing mechanism (RISC) that supports TADF is able to compete with internal conversion and triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) in the polymer chains and generates efficient TADF emission in the polymer pristine films. Prototype devices with PTZ-DBTO2 dispersed in 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-2,2′-biphenyl (CBP) host give excellent performance with EQE of ≈22\% at low luminance ({\textless}100 cd m−2), for 100 cd m−2 the EQE is 19.4\%. In the case of solution processed devices, using the novel TADF polymers, the performance is much lower, EQE ≈3.5\% at 100 cd m−2, which is still the highest value for a polymer TADF system at useful brightness, yet reported. This results from a combination of weak charge transport properties in these materials and device fabrication methods that require further improvement. Nevertheless, these results pave the way to explore TADF in polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs), using less costly deposition methods, such as spin-coating and inkjet printing, which are more appropriate for large area deposition.},

	abstract = {A theoretical study of the relationship between interatomic distances and the spectral positions of valence‐ and K‐shell σ* photoionization resonances is reported for a selected series of molecules. Three‐dimensional graphical representations of the occupied and virtual‐valence σ‐symmetry orbitals of these compounds reveal their striking similarity to the wave functions of a particle in a cylindrical well, substantiating qualitative notions long employed in free‐electron molecular orbital (FEMO) approximations. Accordingly, the molecular potential along the symmetry axis in these compounds is modeled after a finite square well, with a depth approximately equal to the energy of the lowest σ‐symmetry valence molecular orbital and a width determined from analogies to FEMO theory. Calculated minimal‐basis‐set molecular‐orbital energies for both occupied and virtual states are seen to correlate accurately with the simple square‐well energy level formula (π2 /2)(n 2/l 2 ) when measured in Hartree atomic units from the bottom of the well. The calculated σ* orbital energies are furthermore in excellent agreement with experimentally and theoretically determined valence‐shell photoionization resonance positions, the latter consequently also satisfying the square‐well correlation formula. A similar situation obtains for experimentally and theoretically determined K‐shell resonance positions, although energy shifts from minimal‐basis values are evident in these cases. These circumstances are clarified quantitatively on basis of Feshbach–Fano considerations, in which minimal‐basis‐set virtual‐valence σ* orbitals play the roles of zeroth‐order states subject to modification by interactions with nonresonant background continua. Concluding remarks contrast and compare molecular‐orbital and square‐well approaches to photoionization resonances with those based on multiple‐scattering and barrier models. The present results appear to clarify the origins of recently reported empirical correlations of bond lengths with resonance positions, and help to determine their range of applicability.},

	abstract = {The correlation‐consistent polarized valence basis sets (cc‐pVXZ) for the atoms boron through neon have been extended to treat core and core‐valence correlation effects. Basis functions were added to the existing cc‐pVXZ sets to form correlation‐consistent polarized core‐valence sets (cc‐pCVXZ) in the usual pattern: Double zeta added (1s1p), triple zeta added (2s2p1d), quadruple zeta added (3s3p2d1f), and quintuple zeta added (4s4p3d2f1g). The exponents of the core functions were determined by minimizing the difference between all‐electron and valence‐only correlation energies obtained from HF+1+2 calculations on the ground states of the atoms. With the cc‐pCVXZ sets, core, core‐valence, and valence correlation energies all converge exponentially toward apparent complete basis set (CBS) limits, as do the corresponding all‐electron singles and doubles CI energies. Several test applications of the new sets are presented: The first two ionization potentials of boron, the 3 P–5 S separation in carbon, and the X̃ 3 B 1–ã 1 A 1 state separation in CH2. As expected, correlation effects involving the core electrons of the first row atoms, B–Ne, are small but must be included if high accuracy is required.},

A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

Although considerable progress has been made in molecular design approaches for TADF materials, it still remains an unaddressed issue how molecular aggregated states or supramolecular structures determine the TADF property of organic solids. Herein, we present an organic molecule 3-(10H-phenoxazin-10-yl)-9H-xanthen-9-one (3-PXZ-XO) with TADF and polymorph characteristics. Three kinds of 3-PXZ-XO based crystals A, B, and C with different TADF properties were obtained. The three crystals display obviously different emission maxima (λem,max: 535 nm for A, 555 nm for B, and 576 nm for C), photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (Φ: 51\% for A, 28\% for B, and 39\% for C), and delayed lifetimes of excited states (τTADF: 914 ns for A, 774 ns for B, and 994 ns for C). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that in A, B, and C there are different intermolecular π···π stacking interaction modes between the adjacent donor planes or acceptor planes. The different TADF properties of the three polymorphs are mainly attributed to their different supramolecular structures. Appropriate donor···donor and acceptor···acceptor stacking interactions inducing aggregation structures can strongly enhance TADF property of organic solids.},

	abstract = {A series of mononuclear V(V), V(IV) and V(III) complexes were investigated by V L-edge near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. The spectra show significant sensitivity to the vanadium oxidation state and the coordination environment surrounding the vanadium center. The L-edge spectra are interpreted with the aid of the recently developed Density Functional Theory/Restricted Open Shell Configuration Interaction Singles (DFT/ROCIS) method. This method is calibrated for the prediction of vanadium L-edges with different hybrid density functionals and basis sets. For the B3LYP/def2-TZVP(-f) and BHLYP/def2-TZVP(-f) functional/basis-set combinations, good to excellent agreement between calculated and experimental spectra is obtained. A treatment of the spin-orbit coupling interaction to all orders is achieved by quasi-degenerate perturbation theory (QDPT), in conjunction with DFT/ROCIS for the calculation of the molecular multiplets while accounting for dynamic correlation and anisotropic covalency. The physical origin of the observed spectral features is discussed qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of spin multiplicities, magnetic sublevels and individual 2p to 3d core level excitations. This investigation is an important prerequisite for future applications of the DFT/ROCIS method to vanadium L-edge absorption spectroscopy and vanadium-based heterogeneous catalysts.},

The assessment of conventional exchange-correlation functionals shows that the appropriate portions of Hartree?Fock (HF) exchange for core-excited-state calculations depend on shells:? 70\% and 50\% for K-shell and L-shell excitations, respectively. Therefore, the modified CVR-B3LYP functional is designed to use the appropriate portions of HF exchange, 70\%, 50\%, and 20\%, for K-shell, L-shell, and valence regions separately. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations with the modified CVR-B3LYP functional yield both K-shell and L-shell excitation energies with reasonable accuracy. The modified CVR-B3LYP also provides valence-excitation energies and standard enthalpies of formation accurately. Thus, the modified CVR-B3LYP describes all of the K-shell, L-shell, and valence electrons appropriately.},

The intent of this work is to bridge this gap by providing a general way of extracting the exciton wave function out of a many-body wave function obtained by a quantum chemical excited-state computation. This methodology, which is based on the one-particle transition density matrix, is implemented within the ab initio algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme for the polarization propagator and specifically the evaluation of exciton sizes, i.e., dynamic charge separation distances, is considered. A number of examples are presented. For stacked dimers it is shown that the exciton size for charge separated states corresponds to the intermolecular separation, while it only depends on the monomer size for locally excited states or Frenkel excitons. In the case of conjugated organic polymers, the tool is applied to analyze exciton structure and dynamic charge separation. Furthermore, it is discussed how the methodology may be used for the construction of a charge-transfer diagnostic for time-dependent density-functional theory.},

In large molecules and solids, however, calculating the exact (Hartree–Fock) exchange is computationally expensive, especially for systems with metallic characteristics. In the present work, we develop a new hybrid density functional based on a screened Coulomb potential for the exchange interaction which circumvents this bottleneck. The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree–Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems. The high accuracy of the new screened Coulomb potential hybrid, combined with its computational advantages, makes it widely applicable to large molecules and periodic systems.},

	abstract = {Recently, we have proposed an efficient method in the Kohn?Sham density functional theory (DFT) to study systems with a constraint on their density (Phys. Rev. A 2005, 72, 24502). In our approach, the constrained state is calculated directly by running a fast optimization of the constraining potential at each iteration of the usual self-consistent-field procedure. Here, we show that the same constrained DFT approach applies to systems with multiple constraints on the density. To illustrate the utility of this approach, we focus on the study of long-range charge-transfer (CT) states. We show that constrained DFT is size-consistent:? one obtains the correct long-range CT energy when the donor?acceptor separation distance goes to infinity. For large finite distances, constrained DFT also correctly describes the 1/R dependence of the CT energy on the donor?acceptor separation. We also study a model donor?(amidinium?carboxylate)?acceptor complex, where experiments suggest a proton-coupled electron-transfer process. Constrained DFT is used to explicitly calculate the potential-energy curves of both the donor state and the acceptor state.

	abstract = {A simple way of generating starting orbitals for multiconfigurational SCF calculations (particularly of the CAS type) is to use the natural orbitals of the unrestricted Hartree–Fock wave function. Significant fractional occupancy of a UHF natural orbital indicates that the orbital should be included in the active space; this is illustrated for symmetrically stretched water, for NO, N2O4, and for the transition state on the Me3CO→Me2CO+CH3 reaction surface. Average natural orbitals should be used if there are several UHF solutions for the same state; this restores symmetry broken at the the UHF level. Configuration selection based on fractional occupation appears to be the basis for a reliable automated procedure. The UHF natural orbitals provide good starting orbitals for the two‐configuration SCF and for the 4×4 CAS wave function in stretched F2, H2O2, and C2H6, methane, water, in twisted ethylene, in ozone, and for various CAS wave functions in the first asynchronous transition state of the HCNO+H2C2 1,3‐cycloaddition. Comparison is made with the extended Hartree–Fock method.},

Phosphorescence decay of the polymer occurs on a 10–100−μs scale obeying a power law and suggestive of nonradiative quenching, while that of the oligomer is asymptotically exponential with an intrinsic decay time of ≃250ms. The polymer also exhibits delayed fluorescence. It originates from delayed recombination of geminate electron-hole pairs rather than from triplet-triplet annihilation.},

The interpretation and interrelation of these spectra are discussed. The changes in the local structure were systematically studied as a function of nitrogen content. Deconvolution of the C 1s and N 1s XPS spectra shows that the sp3–C fraction decreases with an increase in nitrogen content. The π* peak at the C K (carbon K) and at the N K (nitrogen K) edges were systematically studied. Comparison of intensities of the π* peak confirms the formation of CN bond at the expense of CC bond. Analysis of NEXAFS spectra at N K edge revealed as the nitrogen concentration in the films increases, the π*/σ* intensity ratio increases, indicating that there is an increase of the amount of CN bond relative to the C–N bonds. Raman parameters, such as G peak width, ID/IG ratio, skewness of the G line (Q), were critically analysed in terms of N content and sp2 content of the films. We demonstrate that the combined study of normalised Raman, XPS and NEXAFS spectra is very useful in determining the role of nitrogen incorporation in the structure of ta-C films. The hardness values, measured by nanoindentation technique reduced at higher (\&gt;7 at.\%) N content films.},

Their mathematical expressions are given and an extensive phenomenological discussion is provided to aid the interpretation of the results. Starting from several standard procedures, e.g., population analysis, natural orbital decomposition, and density plotting, we proceed to more advanced concepts of natural transition orbitals and attachment/detachment densities. In addition, special focus is laid on information coded in the transition density matrix and its phenomenological analysis in terms of an electron-hole picture. Taking advantage of both the orbital and real space representations of the density matrices, the physical information in these analysis methods is outlined, and similarities and differences between the approaches are highlighted. Moreover, new analysis tools for excited states are introduced including state averaged natural transition orbitals, which give a compact description of a number of states simultaneously, and natural difference orbitals (defined as the eigenvectors of the difference density matrix), which reveal details about orbital relaxation effects.},

	abstract = {We present a class of methods for extracting a polarized atomic orbital (EPAO) minimal basis set from a converged molecular orbital (MO) calculation. Unlike minimal basis sets obtained from previous approaches, EPAOs rigorously contain the occupied molecular orbital space. EPAOs achieve this exactness because their spatial extent is not restricted. Nonetheless, EPAOs are optimally localized with respect to a localization criterion and are essentially single-centered. EPAOs provide an alternative scheme for partitioning the electron density into atomic subspaces. Therefore, they can be used to determine atomic and chemical group properties such as charge populations. Since EPAOs provide a compact description to the occupied space, they may have other computational applications such as in local correlation methods. Additionally, the EPAOs give a description of valence antibonding orbitals that may be appropriate for nondynamical electron correlation. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

The conformation of the molecule in the crystalline state is determined by the formal charge distribution within the molecule which exists as a zwitterion with the negative pyrophosphate chain folded back over the positive, ring portion of the molecule. The oxygen atoms in the pyrophosphate group are in the staggered conformation when viewed along the phosphorus-phosphorus axis. Even though the pyrophosphate is present in this compound as the monoionized monoester, the configuration is the same as that present in the inorganic pyrophosphate ion. From a comparison of three different crystal structures containing the thiamine moiety and from studies with atomic models, it seems plausible that the basic molecular conformation observed in this crystal is maintained in the catalytically active molecule. Knowledge of the detailed crystal structure provides new insight into the biochemical mechanism of reactions catalyzed by thiamine pyrophosphate.},

	abstract = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have emerged as cheaper alternatives to high-performance phosphorescent OLEDs with noble-metal-based dopants. However, the efficiencies of blue TADF OLEDs are still low at high luminance, limiting full-colour display. Here, we report a blue OLED containing a 9,10-dihydroacridine/diphenylsulphone derivative that has a comparable performance to today's best phosphorescent OLEDs. The device offers an external quantum efficiency of 19.5\% and reduced efficiency roll-off characteristics at high luminance. Through computational simulation, we identified six pretwisted intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) molecules with small singlet–triplet CT state splitting but different energy relationships between 3CT and locally excited triplet (3LE) states. Systematic comparison of their excited-state dynamics revealed that CT molecules with a large twist angle can emit efficient and short-lifetime (a few microseconds) TADF when the emission peak energy is high enough and the 3LE state is higher than the 3CT state.

	abstract = {The mean-field solutions of electronic excited states are much less accessible than ground state (e.g.{\textbackslash} Hartree-Fock) solutions. Energy-based optimization methods for excited states, like \${\textbackslash}Delta\$-scf, tend to fall into the lowest solution consistent with a given symmetry -- a problem known as "variational collapse". In this work, we combine the ideas of direct energy-targeting and variance-based optimization in order to describe excited states at the mean-field level. The resulting method, \${\textbackslash}sigma\$-scf, has several advantages. First, it allows one to target any desired excited state by specifying a single parameter: a guess of the energy of that state. It can therefore, in principle, find {\textbackslash}emph\{all\} excited states. Second, it avoids variational collapse by using a variance-based, unconstrained local minimization. As a consequence, all states -- ground or excited -- are treated on an equal footing. Third, it provides an alternate approach to locate \${\textbackslash}Delta\$-scf solutions that are otherwise inaccessible by the usual non-aufbau configuration initial guess. We present results for this new method for small atoms (He, Be) and molecules (H2, HF).},

	abstract = {Orthogonality constrained density functional theory (OCDFT) provides near-edge X-ray absorption (NEXAS) spectra of first-row elements within one electronvolt from experimental values. However, with increasing atomic number, scalar relativistic effects become the dominant source of error in a nonrelativistic OCDFT treatment of core–valence excitations. In this work we report a novel implementation of the spin-free exact-two-component (X2C) one-electron treatment of scalar relativistic effects and its combination with a recently developed OCDFT approach to compute a manifold of core–valence excited states. The inclusion of scalar relativistic effects in OCDFT reduces the mean absolute error of second-row elements core–valence excitations from 10.3 to 2.3 eV. For all the excitations considered, the results from X2C calculations are also found to be in excellent agreement with those from low-order spin-free Douglas–Kroll–Hess relativistic Hamiltonians. The X2C-OCDFT NEXAS spectra of three organotitanium complexes (TiCl4, TiCpCl3, TiCp2Cl2) are in very good agreement with unshifted experimental results and show a maximum absolute error of 5–6 eV. In addition, a decomposition of the total transition dipole moment into partial atomic contributions is proposed and applied to analyze the nature of the Ti pre-edge transitions in the three organotitanium complexes.},

The K pre-edge structure is then modelled for a selection of 3d transition metal compounds and analyzed using first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) in the local density approximation (LDA). The selected compounds under study are presented in an ascending order of electronic structure complexity, starting with the Ti K-edge of rutile and anatase, and finishing with the Fe K-edge of the cyanomet-myoglobin. In most cases, the calculations are compared to polarized experimental spectra. It is shown that DFT-LDA methods enable us to reproduce satisfactorily the experimental features and to understand the nature of the electronic transitions involved in the pre-edge region. The limiting aspects of such methods in modelling the core-hole electron interaction and the 3d electron-electron repulsion are also pointed out.},

Near the oxygen K-edge (∼530 eV) a fine-structure pattern very similar to that found for gaseous water monomers is observed when the surface-selective total ion yield (TIY) is measured, but a broadened and blue-shifted spectrum emerges when detecting the bulk-sensitive total electron yield (TEY). TIY EXAFS measurements produce a nearest neighbor O−O distance for surface molecules (3.00 {\AA}) slightly longer than that of the isolated water dimer (2.98 {\AA}), whereas the O−O distance extracted from TEY EXAFS corresponds to that accepted for bulk water (2.85 {\AA}). Together, these results evidence an equilibrium liquid water surface dominated by water molecules interacting weakly at longer distances than in the bulk, thus supporting predictions from computer simulations.},

These spectra are compared to inner shell electron energy loss spectra of gaseous triphenylsilanol, hexaphenyldisilane, trimethylmethoxysilane, hexamethyldisiloxane, and hexamethyldisilane in the Si 2p and C 1s regions, measured under scattering conditions where electric dipole transitions dominate (2.5 keV residual energy, θ ≤ 2°). Comparison of the Si 1s and Si 2p spectra of the Ph3Si−X and Me3Si−X species shows there are low-lying transitions at Si which occur exclusively in the Ph3Si−X species. These transitions are attributed to (Si 1s-1,π*Si-Ph) and (Si 2p-1,π*Si-Ph) states in which the core excited electron is delocalized across the Si−C(phenyl) bond into the π* levels of the phenyl ring. Extended H{\"u}ckel and ab initio molecular orbital calculations of the core excitation spectra support this interpretation. Transitions characteristic of Si−Si and Si−O bonds are also identified.},

Molecules that have a charge transfer (CT) excited state can potentially achieve this through the mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Here, it is shown that a D–A charge transfer molecule in the solid state, can emit not only via an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) excited state, but also from exciplex states, formed between the molecule and the host material. OLEDs based on a previously studied D–A–D molecule in a host TAPC achieves {\textgreater}14\% external electroluminescence yield and shows nearly 100\% efficient triplet harvesting. In these devices, it is unambiguously established that the triplet states are harvested via TADF, but more interestingly, these results are found to be independent of whether the emitter is the ICT state or the D–A–D/host exciplex.},

	abstract = {A method is presented for expressing the occupied self-consistent-field (SCF) orbitals of a molecule exactly in terms of chemically deformed atomic minimal-basis-set orbitals that deviate as little as possible from free-atom SCF minimal-basis orbitals. The molecular orbitals referred to are the exact SCF orbitals, the free-atom orbitals referred to are the exact atomic SCF orbitals, and the formulation of the deformed “quasiatomic minimal-basis-sets” is independent of the calculational atomic orbital basis used. The resulting resolution of molecular orbitals in terms of quasiatomic minimal basis set orbitals is therefore intrinsic to the exact molecular wave functions. The deformations are analyzed in terms of interatomic contributions. The Mulliken population analysis is formulated in terms of the quasiatomic minimal-basis orbitals. In the virtual SCF orbital space the method leads to a quantitative ab initio formulation of the qualitative model of virtual valence orbitals, which are useful for calculating electron correlation and the interpretation of reactions. The method is applicable to Kohn–Sham density functional theory orbitals and is easily generalized to valence MCSCF orbitals.},

This wrong “Schr{\"o}dinger limit” is shown to be the main reason for the phenomenon known as “variational collapse.” After a short review of existing proposals to overcome the “variational collapse,” a systematic study of the possible ways to avoid it is given. All discussed approaches are analyzed in terms of various criteria that one wants to fulfill. The most promising approach consists of a free-particle Foldy–Wouthuysen (FW) transformation on operator level and a back transformation on matrix level (approaches C2 and C3). This implies a modification of the free-electron part of the matrix representation of the Dirac operator and leads to the correct Schr{\"o}dinger limit (and if one wishes even the correct Pauli limit) in the same basis (and to the exact results for a complete basis). The potential energy is unchanged, which makes the application to n -electron systems straightforward. Projection of the Dirac operator to positive energy states does not remove the variational collapse unless this is done in a very special way.},

In this work we extend OCDFT to compute core-excited states and generalize the original formalism to determine multiple excited states. Benchmark computations on a set of 13 small molecules and 40 excited states show that unshifted OCDFT/B3LYP excitation energies have a mean absolute error of 1.0 eV. Contrary to time-dependent DFT, OCDFT excitation energies for first- and second-row elements are computed with near-uniform accuracy. OCDFT core excitation energies are insensitive to the choice of the functional and the amount of Hartree-Fock exchange. We show that OCDFT is a powerful tool for the assignment of X-ray absorption spectra of large molecules by simulating the gas-phase near-edge spectrum of adenine and thymine.},

	abstract = {Near carbon K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectra of a series of fluorine-substituted ethenes and acetone have been studied using coupled cluster and density functional theory (DFT) polarization propagator methods, as well as the static-exchange (STEX) approach. With the complex polarization propagator (CPP) implemented in coupled cluster theory, relaxation effects following the excitation of core electrons are accounted for in terms of electron correlation, enabling a systematic convergence of these effects with respect to electron excitations in the cluster operator. Coupled cluster results have been used as benchmarks for the assessment of propagator methods in DFT as well as the state-specific static-exchange approach. Calculations on ethene and 1,1-difluoroethene illustrate the possibility of using nonrelativistic coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) with additional effects of electron correlation and relativity added as scalar shifts in energetics. It has been demonstrated that CPP spectra obtained with coupled cluster singles and approximate doubles (CC2), CCSD, and DFT (with a Coulomb attenuated exchange-correlation functional) yield excellent predictions of chemical shifts for vinylfluoride, 1,1-difluoroethene, trifluoroethene, as well as good spectral features for acetone in the case of CCSD and DFT. Following this, CPP-DFT is considered to be a viable option for the calculation of X-ray absorption spectra of larger π-conjugated systems, and CC2 is deemed applicable for chemical shifts but not for studies of fine structure features. The CCSD method as well as the more approximate CC2 method are shown to yield spectral features relating to π*-resonances in good agreement with experiment, not only for the aforementioned molecules but also for ethene, cis-1,2-difluoroethene, and tetrafluoroethene. The STEX approach is shown to underestimate π*-peak separations due to spectral compressions, a characteristic which is inherent to this method.},

The OMP2 method is applied to difficult chemical systems, including those where spatial or spin symmetry-breaking instabilities are observed. The performance of the OMP2 method is compared with that of second-order M{\o}ller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) for investigating geometries and vibrational frequencies of the cis-HOOH+, trans-HOOH+, LiO2, C 3 + , and NO2 molecules. For harmonic vibrational frequencies, the OMP2 method eliminates the singularities arising from the abnormal response contributions observed for MP2 in case of symmetry-breaking problems, and provides significantly improved vibrational frequencies for the above molecules. We also consider the hydrogen transfer reactions between several free radicals, for which MP2 provides poor reaction energies. The OMP2 method again exhibits a considerably better performance than MP2, providing a mean absolute error of 2.3 kcal mol−1, which is more than 5 times lower than that of MP2 (13.2 kcal mol−1). Overall, the OMP2 method seems quite helpful for electronically challenging chemical systems such as symmetry-breaking molecules, hydrogen transfer reactions, or other cases where standard MP2 proves unreliable. For such systems, we recommend using OMP2 instead of MP2 as a more robust method with the same computational scaling.},

It is therefore useful to have computational protocols for accurate estimation of their electronic spectra in order to screen candidate molecules for OLED applications. However, it is difficult to predict the photophysical properties of TADF molecules with LR-TDDFT, as semilocal LR-TDDFT is incapable of accurately modeling CT states. Herein, we study absorption energies, emission energies, zero–zero transition energies, and singlet–triplet gaps of TADF molecules using a restricted open-shell Kohn–Sham (ROKS) approach instead and discover that ROKS calculations with semilocal hybrid functionals are in good agreement with experiments—unlike TDDFT, which significantly underestimates energy gaps. We also propose a cheap computational protocol for studying excited states with large CT character that is found to give good agreement with experimental results without having to perform any excited-state geometry optimizations.},

	abstract = {Of all the different areas in computational chemistry, density functional theory (DFT) enjoys the most rapid development. Even at the level of the local density approximation (LDA), which is computationally less demanding, DFT can usually provide better answers than Hartree-Fock formalism for large systems such as clusters and solids. For atoms and molecules, the results from DFT often rival those obtained by ab initio quantum chemistry, partly because larger basis sets can be used. Such encouraging results have in turn stimulated workers to further investigate the formal theory as well as the computational methodology of DFT.This volume contains ten contributions from active workers in DFT, covering topics from basic principles to methodology to applications. In the Foreword, Prof Walter Kohn gives his perspective on the recent advances in DFT. Because DFT is being developed in so many different directions, no single volume can provide a complete review of DFT. However, this volume will help both beginners and experimentalists to read the growing DFT literature more easily.Contents:Foreword (W Kohn)Exact Relations for the Electron Density and Energy Functionals ({\'A} Nagy)Correlation in Molecules (S Suba \&amp; M A Whitehead)Reinterpretation of Electron Correlations within Density Functional Theory: Hartree, Local Density and Gradient Expansion Approximations via the Work Formalism of Electronic Structure (V Sahni)Beyond the Kohn–Sham Determinant (A Savin)Time-Dependent Density Functional Response Theory for Molecules (M E Casida)Evaluation and Application of Corrected Effective Medium Methods (A E DePristo)Infrared Spectra of Binding Energies of Transition Metal–Monoligand Complexes (R Fournier \&amp; I P{\'a}pai)Structure, Magnetic Properties and Reactivities of Open-Shell Species from Density Functional and Self-Consistent Hybrid Methods (V Barone)Gaussian Density Functional Method: An Alternative Tool for the Prediction of Physico-Chemical Properties (N Russo et al.)The Electron Density as Calculated from Density Functional Theory (R J Boyd et al.)Readership: Researchers and graduate students in computational chemistry and computational physics.keywords:Density-Functional;DFT;Quantum Chemistry;Computational Chemistry;Kohn-Sham;Electron Density;Continuum Dielectric;Self-Interaction;Exchange-Correlation;Time-Dependent Response“… very useful when quantum chemists use the density functional method.”Suehiro IwataOkazaki National Research Institute, Japan“Overall, the quality of the chapters is very high … it will help both beginners and experimentalists (as well as DFT experts) to read the growing DFT literature more easily.”Theoretical Chemistry Accounts“… this volume will help both beginners and experimentalists to read the growing DFT literature more easily.”Mathematics Abstracts},

We briefly describe our restricted excitation window TDDFT (REW-TDDFT) approach for core excitations, which has also been reported by other groups. This is followed by a detailed discussion of real-time TDDFT techniques tailored to core excitations, including obtaining spectral information through delta-function excitation, postprocessing time-dependent signals, and resonant excitation through quasi-monochromatic excitation. We present results for the oxygen K-edge of water and carbon monoxide; the carbon K-edge of carbon monoxide; the ruthenium L3-edge for the hexaamminerutheium(III) ion, including scalar relativistic corrections via the zeroth order regular approximation (ZORA); and the carbon and fluorine K-edges for a series of fluorobenzenes. In all cases, the calculated spectra are found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental results, requiring only a uniform shift ranging from ?4 eV to +19 eV, i.e., on the order of a few percent of the excitation energy. Real-time TDDFT visualization of excited state charge densities is used to visually examine the nature of each excitation, which gives insight into the effects of atoms bound to the absorbing center.},

To this end, we have examined the gas phase sulfur 1s NEXAFS spectra of a group of simple thiol and thioether compounds. These high-resolution gas phase spectra are free of solid-state broadening, charging, and saturation effects common in the NEXAFS spectra of solids. These experimental data have been further analyzed with the aid of improved virtual orbital Hartree–Fock ab initio calculations. The experimental sulfur 1s NEXAFS spectra show fine features predicted by calculation, and the combination of experiment and calculation has been used to improve assignment of spectroscopic features relevant for the speciation and quantification of the sulfur compounds.},

Also, the correct 1/R asymptotic behavior of CT states with respect to a distance coordinate R between the separated charges of the CT state is not reproduced by TDDFT employing these xc-functionals. Here, we demonstrate by analysis of the TDDFT equations that the first failure is due to the self-interaction error in the orbital energies from the ground-state DFT calculation, while the latter is a similar self-interaction error in TDDFT arising through the electron transfer in the CT state. Possible correction schemes, such as inclusion of exact Hartree?Fock or exact Kohn?Sham exchange, as well as aspects of the exact xc-functional are discussed in this context. Furthermore, a practical approach is proposed which combines the benefits of TDDFT and configuration interaction singles (CIS) and which does not suffer from electron-transfer self-interaction. The latter approach is applied to a (1,4)-phenylene-linked zincbacteriochlorin?bacteriochlorin complex and to a bacteriochlorophyll?spheroidene complex, in which CT states may play important roles in energy and electron-transfer processes. The errors of TDDFT alone for the CT states are demonstrated, and reasonable estimates for the true excitation energies of these states are given.},

	abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Alml{\"o}f, Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects i f the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (s p) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations i f the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Alml{\"o}f and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of c o r r e l a t i o n c o n s i s t e n t b a s i s s e t s, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99\% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50\% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94\%–97\% of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

	abstract = {Full potential x-ray spectroscopy simulations of hexagonal ice and liquid water are performed by means of the newly implemented methodology based on the Gaussian augmented plane waves formalism. The computed spectra obtained within the supercell approach are compared to experimental data. The variations of the spectral distribution determined by the quality of the basis set, the size of the sample, and the choice of the core-hole potential are extensively discussed. The second part of this work is focused on the understanding of the connections between specific configurations of the hydrogen bond network and the corresponding contributions to the x-ray absorption spectrum in liquid water. Our results confirm that asymmetrically coordinated molecules, in particular, those donating only one or no hydrogen bond, are associated with well identified spectral signatures that differ significantly from the ice spectral profile. However, transient local structures, with half formed hydrogen bonds, may still give rise to spectra with dominant postedge contributions and relatively weaker oscillator strengths at lower energy. This explains why by averaging the spectra over all the O atoms of liquid instantaneous configurations extracted from ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories, the spectral features indicating the presence of weak or broken hydrogen bonds turn out to be attenuated and sometimes not clearly distinguishable.},

The calculated values are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values for the hydrocarbon species but are significantly underestimated for CO.

One way of increasing emission efficiency is triplet harvesting. This can be achieved by thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) when triplet and singlet excited states are quasi degenerate. Molecular building units are selected and bound in a specific pattern to allow for increase in emission performance, also due to TADF. Using time-dependent density functional theory, the relevant singlet–singlet and triplet-singlet energy gaps corresponding to absorption or emission transitions of the compounds are computed to simulate the electroluminescent spectrum. The results are analyzed in depth and relations between some spectral and structural properties are proposed. The best suited molecules are delineated as potential OLED building blocks. Guidelines for systematic improvement of the molecular characteristics are outlined.},

In the most flexible \{AO\} basis studied (69 AO's) a 1s \{IP\} of 410.01 eV is obtained in good agreement with the corresponding experimental value of 409.9 eV; the energy difference between the 1σ−1g ion and its lowest shake-up state is calculated to be 9.39 eV versus 9.3 eV experimentally.},

	abstract = {The fundamental problem of the symmetry breaking in the resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) of the CO2 gas molecule is studied. The measurements were performed under catalytically relevant conditions within an in-house constructed reaction cell. The experimental RIXS plane is constructed from a sequence of resonances, covering the near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectrum up to 539 eV. The spectra show significant sensitivity with respect to the excitation frequency. The NEXAFS absorption spectrum, as well as the corresponding RIXS spectra, is interpreted with the aid of multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) theory. In this framework, the configuration interaction space spans the space of the intermediate and final states with single and single?double excitations. The dynamic character of the RIXS spectra is investigated by considering the electronic?nuclear vibrational coupling with the bending and antisymmetric stretching vibrations in the important intermediate excited states. In addition, the vibronic coupling mechanism involving the Renner?Teller effect and the core?hole localization pseudo-Jahn?Teller effect of the intermediate states is fully considered. The physical origin of the observed spectral features is discussed qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of individual core-to-valence excitations and valence-to-core decays, respectively. The computational protocol presented here, based on multireference wave function ab initio theory, serves as an important reference for future theoretical and experimental applications of RIXS spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {For chemically accurate excited state energies, one is forced to include electron?electron correlation at a level of theory significantly higher than configuration interaction singles (CIS). Post-CIS corrections do exist, but most often, if they are computationally inexpensive, these methods rely on perturbation theory. At the same time, inexpensive variational post-CIS methods would be ideal since modeling electronic relaxation usually requires globally smooth potential energy surfaces (PESs) and there will inevitably be regions of near electronic degeneracy. With that goal in mind, we now present a new method entitled variationally orbital adapted CIS (VOA-CIS). On the one hand, we show that in the ground-state geometry, VOA-CIS performs comparably to CIS(D) at predicting relative excited state energies. On the other hand, far beyond CIS(D) or any other perturbative method, VOA-CIS correctly rebalances the energy of charge-transfer (CT) states versus non-CT states, while simultaneously producing smooth PESs?including the important case of avoided crossings. In fact, through localized diabatization of VOA-CIS excited states, one can find a set of reasonable diabatic states modeling CT chemical dynamics. After significant benchmarking, we are now confident VOA-CIS and VOA-CIS-like methods should play a major role in future excited state calculations.},

All discussed approaches are analyzed in terms of various criteria that one wants to fulfill. The most promising approach consists of a free-particle Foldy–Wouthuysen (FW) transformation on operator level and a back transformation on matrix level (approaches C2 and C3). This implies a modification of the free-electron part of the matrix representation of the Dirac operator and leads to the correct Schr{\"o}dinger limit (and if one wishes even the correct Pauli limit) in the same basis (and to the exact results for a complete basis). The potential energy is unchanged, which makes the application to n -electron systems straightforward. Projection of the Dirac operator to positive energy states does not remove the variational collapse unless this is done in a very special way.},

The most straightforward approximate Hamiltonian for interacting electrons is derived from quantum electrodynamics (QED) in Coulomb gauge with the neglect of transversal photons. This allows an exact (non-perturbative) decoupling of the electromagnetic field from the fermionic field. The electric interaction of the fermions is non-retarded and non-quantized. The quantization of the fermionic field leads to a polarizable vacuum. The simplest (but somewhat problematic) approximation is a no-pair projected theory with external-field projectors. The Dirac-Coulomb operator in configuration space (first quantization) is not acceptable, even if the Brown–Ravenhall disease is much less virulent than often claimed. Effects of transversal photons, such as the Breit interaction and renormalized self-interaction can be taken care of perturbatively at the end, but there are still many open questions.},

	doi = {10.1063/1.4804607},
	abstract = {A novel restricted-open-shell configuration interaction with singles (ROCIS) approach for the calculation of transition metal L-edge X-ray absorption spectra is introduced. In this method, one first calculates the ground state and a number of excited states of the non-relativistic Hamiltonian. By construction, the total spin is a good quantum number in each of these states. For a ground state with total spin S excited states with spin S′ = S, S − 1, and S + 1 are constructed. Using Wigner-Eckart algebra, all magnetic sublevels with MS = S, …, −S for each multiplet of spin S are obtained. The spin-orbit operator is represented by a mean-field approximation to the full Breit-Pauli spin-orbit operator and is diagonalized over this N-particle basis. This is equivalent to a quasi-degenerate treatment of the spin-orbit interaction to all orders. Importantly, the excitation space spans all of the molecular multiplets that arise from the atomic Russell-Saunders terms. Hence, the method represents a rigorous first-principles approach to the complicated low-symmetry molecular multiplet problem met in L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In order to gain computational efficiency, as well as additional accuracy, the excitation space is restricted to single excitations and the configuration interaction matrix is slightly parameterized in order to account for dynamic correlation effects in an average way. To this end, it is advantageous to employ Kohn-Sham rather than Hartree-Fock orbitals thus defining the density functional theory/ROCIS method. However, the method can also be used in an entirely non-empirical fashion. Only three global empirical parameters are introduced and have been determined here for future application of the method to any system containing any transition metal. The three parameters were carefully calibrated using the L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy spectra of a test set of coordination complexes containing first row transition metals. These parameters are universal and transferable. Hence, there are no adjustable parameters that are used to fit experimental X-ray absorption spectra. Thus, the new approach classifies as a predictive first-principles method rather than an analysis tool. A series of calculations on transition metal compounds containing Cu, Ti, Fe, and Ni in various oxidation and spin states is investigated and a detailed comparison to experimental data is reported. In most cases, the approach yields good to excellent agreement with experiment. In addition, the origin of the observed spectral features is discussed in terms of the electronic structure of the investigated compounds.},

Detailed computations and spectral (natural orbital) treatment of the CIS density matrices of various types are presented. The corresponding hole-particle densities and related excitation localization indices are described. All the quantities are extended to the excited states calculated in the random phase approximation and closely related time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The localization indices and charge transfer numbers which are invoked to describe interfragment interactions provide a basis for our scheme which is referred to as the excited state structural analysis for electronic transitions. The proposed analysis is exemplified by various moderate and large-size conjugated molecules treated within ab initio TDDFT and the Parizer–Parr–Pople approximation. Finally, we propose a possible generalization to the electronic transitions between CIS-like states followed by applications to singlet organic biradicals treated within the π-electron spin-flip CIS. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The systematic disparity between experimental and calculated transition energies was used to develop a semiempirical correction for this class of transitions, allowing us to map calculated transition energies onto a corrected, experimental energy scale. The correction method was applied to a large set of calculated core C 1s (C−R) → π*CC transition energies, and used to prepare a chemically wide-ranging NEXAFS correlation diagram for the “C−R π* band”. We demonstrate the usefulness of this correlation diagram for the analytical application of NEXAFS spectroscopy and microscopy to organic materials.},

	abstract = {The air–water interface is perhaps the most common liquid interface. It covers more than 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface and strongly affects atmospheric, aerosol and environmental chemistry. The air–water interface has also attracted much interest as a model system that allows rigorous tests of theory, with one fundamental question being just how thin it is. Theoretical studies have suggested a surprisingly short ‘healing length’ of about 3 {a}ngstr{\"o}ms (1 {\AA} = 0.1 nm), with the bulk-phase properties of water recovered within the top few monolayers. However, direct experimental evidence has been elusive owing to the difficulty of depth-profiling the liquid surface on the {a}ngstr{\"o}m scale. Most physical, chemical and biological properties of water, such as viscosity, solvation, wetting and the hydrophobic effect, are determined by its hydrogen-bond network. This can be probed by observing the lineshape of the OH-stretch mode, the frequency shift of which is related to the hydrogen-bond strength. Here we report a combined experimental and theoretical study of the air–water interface using surface-selective heterodyne-detected vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy to focus on the ‘free OD’ transition found only in the topmost water layer. By using deuterated water and isotopic dilution to reveal the vibrational coupling mechanism, we find that the free OD stretch is affected only by intramolecular coupling to the stretching of the other OD group on the same molecule. The other OD stretch frequency indicates the strength of one of the first hydrogen bonds encountered at the surface; this is the donor hydrogen bond of the water molecule straddling the interface, which we find to be only slightly weaker than bulk-phase water hydrogen bonds. We infer from this observation a remarkably fast onset of bulk-phase behaviour on crossing from the air into the water phase.},

	abstract = {The theoretical description of core‐excitation spectra presents a difficult problem due to the large excitation energies involved, and the extensive relaxation effects that occur upon promotion of a core electron to a valence or Rydberg level. For this reason we follow a two‐step procedure to evaluate core‐excitation energies. We start from a coupled cluster singles‐doubles (CCSD) description of the core ion to include the large relaxation effects, followed by adding an extra electron to the core‐ionized state to obtain the various core‐excited states of the neutral by using the open‐shell electron attachment equation‐of‐motion coupled cluster method (EA‐EOMCC). An important feature of the approach is that the term values, the core‐excitation energies relative to the relevant core‐ionization potential, are calculated directly and this allows us to achieve high accuracy. This work describes the extension of the EA‐EOMCC method to open‐shell reference states and we make applications to a number of molecular systems. The assignment of recently obtained high‐resolution core‐excitation spectra for acetylene and ethylene is discussed, and we compare our open‐shell EA‐EOMCC results to results obtained from closed‐shell EA‐EOMCC calculations based on the equivalent core ion corresponding to the core‐excited molecular system. Special attention is paid to the singlet–triplet splitting for core‐excited states, and we address the multireference character of core‐ionized and core‐excited states for molecules that contain symmetry‐equivalent heavy nuclei, which relates to a persistent controversy in the literature concerning localized versus delocalized core holes.},

Using DFT and TDDFT calculations, we gained the electron distribution of HOMO and LUMO and the energy of the lowest singlet (S1) and the lowest triplet (T1) excited states. All of the materials have a small spatial overlap between HOMO and LUMO because of the relatively large dihedral angle between the phenyl ring and the acceptor moiety. In terms of the energy difference (ΔE ST) between the S1 state and the T1 state, PXZ-PI, PXZ-BI, and ACR-BI showed the small ΔE ST. However, ACR-PI showed the large ΔE ST.

	abstract = {A diagonalisation procedure of the Foldy-Wouthuysen type is considered for the single-electron Dirac Hamiltonian as a basis for many-body applications. A modified procedure is suggested. In the diagonalisation procedure the Dirac equation is completely decoupled into two equations of the Pauli type. The expressions for positive- and negative-energy projection operators in the transformed basis are then trivial and, by performing the inverse transformation, projection operators for Dirac functions are obtained. Applying a similar transformation to the two-electron Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian leads to a diagonalised single-electron part and a non-diagonal two-electron interaction. In principle, the effect of the exchange of virtual, transverse photons (Breit interactions) can also be included in the electron-electron interaction and transformed in a similar way. It is indicated how a diagonalisation procedure of this kind can be used as a basis for relativistic many-body calculations in the coupled cluster formulation in analogy with the corresponding non-relativistic procedure.},

The present work confirms the earlier estimate of −4.9 kcal/mol as the MP2(FC) basis set limit. Core/valence correlation effects are found to increase the binding energy by ∼0.05 kcal/mol. The best estimate of the electronic binding energy of the water dimer is −5.0 ± 0.1 kcal/mol. Correcting this value for zero-point and temperature effects yields the value ΔH(375) = −3.2 ± 0.1 kcal/mol. This value is within the error limits of the best experimental estimate of −3.6 ± 0.5 kcal/mol with the calculations favoring the lower end of the experimental energy range. It should be useful to adopt the present estimate in empirical and semiempirical model potentials.},

The consequences of 3d-spin–orbit coupling and of 3d systems in symmetries lower than cubic are discussed. The second part of the paper gives a short overview of all X-ray spectroscopies, where the focus is on the multiplet aspects of those spectroscopies and on the various configurations that play a role in combined spectroscopies such as resonant photoemission, resonant X-ray emission and coincidence spectroscopy. The review is concluded with a section that gives an overview of the use of multiplet theory for 3d coordination compounds.

This is the basis of the corresponding orbital transformation of Amos and Hall. Their transformation is shown to have widespread application to quantum chemistry. It leads to a simple generalization of the Slater—Condon rules for the expectation value of an operator between two determinantal wavefunctions when the spin orbitals of one function have no simple orthogonality relationship to those of the other function. In the case of single‐determinantal wavefunctions, use of the corresponding orbital transformation and the integral Hellmann—Feynman formula leads to a very simple expression for the energy difference associated with two similar configurations of a molecular system. Extensions to limited configuration interaction expansions are discussed. Given single‐determinantal wavefunctions for two related molecular systems, it is shown that the corresponding orbitals are those which are most nearly molecularly invariant in the sense of maximum overlap. A comparison of the Pitzer—Lipscomb wavefunctions for the staggered and eclipsed forms of ethane reveals that six of the nine corresponding orbitals have an overlap of no less than 0.999998 in the two configurations. Use of the corresponding orbital transformation overcomes various computational difficulties encountered with L{\"o}wdin's cofactor method for treating the nonorthogonality problem.},

Deoxyribose and ribose sugars can cause at most 0.2 eV narrowing of ?, while the phosphate groups have nearly negligible effects on the spectra. Two kinds of intermolecule interactions are analyzed, the hydrogen bonds and the stacking effect, by comparing ?compressed? and ?expanded? models or by comparing models including or excluding the nearest stacking molecules. The shortening of hydrogen-bond length by 0.2?0.3 {\AA} can result in the reduction of ? by 0.2?0.8 eV. This is because the hydrogen bonds make the electrons more delocalized, and the amine and imine nitrogens become less distinguishable. Moreover, the hydrogen bond has a different ability to influence the spectra of different crystals, with guanine crystals as the largest (change by 0.8 eV) and the guanosine crystal as the smallest (change by 0.2 eV). The stacking has negligible effects on the spectra in all studied systems. A comparison of guanosine to guanine crystals shows that the sugars in the crystal could create ?blocks? in the π-and hydrogen bonds network of bases and thus makes the imine and amine nitrogens more distinguishable with a larger ?. Our theoretical calculations offer a good match with experimental findings and explain earlier discrepancies in the NEXAFS analysis.},

	abstract = {We present a perspective on the use of diffuse basis functions for electronic structure calculations by density functional theory and wave function theory. We especially emphasize minimally augmented basis sets and calendar basis sets. We base our conclusions on our previous experience with commonly computed quantities, such as bond energies, barrier heights, electron affinities, noncovalent (van der Waals and hydrogen bond) interaction energies, and ionization potentials, on Stephens et al.’s results for optical rotation and on our own new calculations (presented here) of polarizabilities and of potential energy curves of van der Waals complexes. We emphasize the benefits of partial augmentation of the higher-zeta basis sets in preference to full augmentation at a lower ζ level. Benefits and limitations of the use of fully, partially, and minimally augmented basis sets are reviewed for different electronic structure methods and molecular properties. We have found that minimal augmentation is almost always enough for density functional theory (DFT) when applied to ionization potentials, electron affinities, atomization energies, barrier heights, and hydrogen-bond energies. For electric dipole polarizabilities, we find that augmentation beyond minimal has an average effect of 8\% at the polarized triple-ζ level and 5\% at the polarized quadruple-ζ level. The effects are larger for potential energy curves of van der Waals complexes. The effects are also larger for wave function theory (WFT). Even for WFT though, full augmentation is not needed for most purposes, and a level of augmentation between minimal and full is optimal for most problems. The calendar basis sets named after the months provide a convergent sequence of partially augmented basis sets that can be used for such calculations. The jun-cc-pV(T+d)Z basis set is very useful for MP2-F12 calculations of barrier heights and hydrogen bond strengths.},

An XAS spectrum is composed of two regions, XANES and EXAFS, which provide element-specific information on formal oxidation state and local coordination environment, respectively. For molecules with similar environments, such as a common ligand set, the energy of the absorption edge can be calibrated from standards to obtain the formal oxidation state of unknown compounds. For structurally complex coordination environments, simulated EXAFS spectra obtained from XRD or DFT-modeled structures can be used to ascertain local structural information from an experimental EXAFS spectrum. With fast data acquisition at modern synchrotrons, it is also possible to follow the kinetic transformation of homogeneous compounds under realistic reaction conditions while gaining insight into the structural and electronic changes happening at the metal atom.},

In this work we extend OCDFT to compute core-excited states and generalize the original formalism to determine multiple excited states. Benchmark computations on a set of 13 small molecules and 40 excited states show that unshifted OCDFT/B3LYP excitation energies have a mean absolute error of 1.0 eV. Contrary to time-dependent DFT, OCDFT excitation energies for first- and second-row elements are computed with near-uniform accuracy. OCDFT core excitation energies are insensitive to the choice of the functional and the amount of Hartree-Fock exchange. We show that OCDFT is a powerful tool for the assignment of X-ray absorption spectra of large molecules by simulating the gas-phase near-edge spectrum of adenine and thymine.},

The quantification and speciation of these compounds is of great interest in different areas such as biology, fossil fuels studies, geology, and archaeology. Sulfur 1s Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy has emerged as a qualitative and quantitative method for sulfur speciation. A firm understanding of the sulfur 1s NEXAFS spectra of organosulfur species is required for these analytical studies. To support this development, the sulfur 1s NEXAFS spectra of simple thiols and thioethers were previously examined, and are now extended to studies of thiophenic and aromatic thioether compounds, in the gas and condensed phases. High-resolution spectra have been further analyzed with the aid of Improved Virtual Orbital (IVO) and Δ(self-consistent field) ab initio calculations. Experimental sulfur 1s NEXAFS spectra show fine features predicted by calculation, and the combination of experiment and calculation has been used to improve the assignment of spectroscopic features important for the speciation and quantification of sulfur compounds. Systematic differences between gas and condensed phases are also explored; these differences suggest a significant role for conformational effects in the NEXAFS spectra of condensed species.},

The most straightforward approximate Hamiltonian for interacting electrons is derived from quantum electrodynamics (QED) in Coulomb gauge with the neglect of transversal photons. This allows an exact (non-perturbative) decoupling of the electromagnetic field from the fermionic field. The electric interaction of the fermions is non-retarded and non-quantized. The quantization of the fermionic field leads to a polarizable vacuum. The simplest (but somewhat problematic) approximation is a no-pair projected theory with external-field projectors. The Dirac-Coulomb operator in configuration space (first quantization) is not acceptable, even if the Brown–Ravenhall disease is much less virulent than often claimed. Effects of transversal photons, such as the Breit interaction and renormalized self-interaction can be taken care of perturbatively at the end, but there are still many open questions.},

To expose the local environment of the excess charge, we report how the vibrational spectrum of protonated water clusters evolves in the size range from 2 to 11 water molecules. Signature bands indicating embedded Eigen or Zundel limiting forms are observed in all of the spectra with the exception of the three- and five-membered clusters. These unique species display bands appearing at intermediate energies, reflecting asymmetric solvation of the core ion. Taken together, the data reveal the pronounced spectral impact of subtle changes in the hydration environment.

B 58 (1998) 8097] and its application to calculations on water in condensed phase. We discuss the absolute energy scale, functional dependence, broadening versus sampling of intra- and intermolecular vibrational modes, treatment of the continuum, cluster size convergence as well as compare with periodic calculations and with experiment; periodic and cluster model calculations are found to agree very closely in the relevant near-edge region although neither reproduces the pre-edge and main-edge features in the experimental spectra of thin ice films. The real-space grid representation of the wave function in the periodic calculations allows a more extended energy range to be described and we find satisfactory agreement with experiment for higher energy continuum resonances. Two proposed alternative approaches using either the potential from a full core-hole (FCH) or the full core-hole with an excited electron in the lowest state (XCH) are shown to lead to spectra that deviate significantly from experiment.},

None of the prominently used DFT approaches show these properties: the optimized effective potential VXC based ab initio dft does. A local, range-separated hybrid potential cam-QTP-00 is introduced as the basis for a “consistent”KS DFT approach. The computed VIPs as the negative of KS eigenvalue have a mean absolute error of 0.8 eV for an extensive set of molecule\&apos;s electron ionizations, including the core. Barrier heights, equilibrium geometries, and magnetic properties obtained from the potential are in good agreement with experiment. A similar accuracy with less computational efforts can be achieved by using a non-variational global hybrid variant of the QTP-00 approach.},

One of the main functions of a DNA polymerase enzyme is to help DNA recognize itself with high specificity when a strand is being copied. Recent studies have shed new light on the question of what physical forces cause a polymerase enzyme to insert a nucleotide into a strand of DNA and to choose the correct nucleotide over the incorrect ones. This is discussed in the light of three main forces that govern DNA recognition: base stacking, Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding, and steric interactions. These factors are studied with natural and structurally altered DNA nucleosides.},

	abstract = {All our former experience with application of quantum theory seems to say that what is predicted by quantum formalism must occur in the laboratory. But the essence of quantum formalism—entanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen, and Schr{\"o}dinger—waited over 70years to enter laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations between subsystems, has potential for many quantum processes, including canonical ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and dense coding. However, it appears that this new resource is complex and difficult to detect. Although it is usually fragile to the environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distillation, and quantification. In particular, various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, and quantum cryptography are discussed, and some interrelations are pointed out. The basic role of entanglement in quantum communication within a distant laboratory paradigm is stressed, and some peculiarities such as the irreversibility of entanglement manipulations are also discussed including its extremal form—the bound entanglement phenomenon. The basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized.},

The low-lying Rydberg and valence excited states of the acetone molecule have been investigated using different N – 1-electron potentials in the construction of virtual orbitals.

	abstract = {The constrained density functional theory–configuration interaction (CDFT-CI) method has previously been used to calculate ground-stateenergies and barrier heights. In this work, it is examined for use in computing electronic excited states, for the challenging case of conical intersections. Conical intersections are a prevalent feature of excited electronic surfaces, but conventional time-dependent density functional theory calculations are found to be entirely unsatisfactory at describing them, for two small systems. CDFT-CI calculations on those systems are found to be in qualitative agreement with reference CAS surfaces. These results suggest that with a suitable definition of atomic populations and a careful choice of constrained states, CDFT-CI could be the basis for a seamless description of electronic degeneracy.},

	abstract = {The thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) mechanism has recently attracted significant interest in the field of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). TADF relies on the presence of a very small energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states. Here, we demonstrate that time-dependent density functional theory in the Tamm–Dancoff approximation can be very successful in calculations of the lowest singlet and triplet excitation energies and the corresponding singlet–triplet gap when using nonempirically tuned range-separated functionals. Such functionals provide very good estimates in a series of 17 molecules used in TADF-based OLED devices with mean absolute deviations of 0.15 eV for the vertical singlet excitation energies and 0.09 eV [0.07 eV] for the adiabatic [vertical] singlet–triplet energy gaps as well as low relative errors and high correlation coefficients compared to the corresponding experimental values. They significantly outperform conventional functionals, a feature which is rationalized on the basis of the amount of exact-exchange included and the delocalization error. The present work provides a reliable theoretical tool for the prediction and development of novel TADF-based materials with low singlet–triplet energetic splittings.},

	abstract = {The photo-luminescence from solid films of poly(para-phenylene vinylene) polymers and an oligomeric model system, consisting of seven repeat units, are investigated at low temperature (8 K) using time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. Results are compared to those for the materials in solution. In the case of the oligomer, the shape of the visible absorption band observed for the film is quite different from the band shape for the polymer in frozen solution and is characteristic of H-type aggregates. Theoretical models are presented describing the dependence of the band shape of absorption and emission spectra on intermolecular excited state interactions, electron-vibration coupling and disorder represented by distributions of the molecular excitation and intermolecular interaction energies. Using these models, it is concluded that intermolecular interactions in the film of the oligomer are strong (⩾1400 cm−1), and the disorder low, implying delocalization of the excitation over several molecules. In accordance with these models the fluorescence lifetime for the film (∼2 ns) is considerably longer than for isolated molecules in solution (0.45 ns). The emission spectra of the film, taken early after excitation, are consistent with delocalization of the excitation over several molecules. A time-dependent red shift of the fluorescence band is observed and interpreted in terms of migration of localized excitations between disorder induced trap sites, which exist in the low energy tail of the density of excited states. For the polymers, differences between the shape of the absorption bands of solid film and frozen solution are smaller than for the oligomer indicating that interchain interactions that are, on average, weaker than for the oligomer. For the polymer films, a time-dependent red shift of the emission is observed and fluorescence depolarization measurements provide direct evidence for migration of the photo-excitations between trap sites. For one polymer, a time dependent change in the band shape of the fluorescence after pulsed excitation is observed with the band shape of the long-lived emission being compatible with that expected for an excitation delocalized over at least two, nearly parallel aligned, chains. For a second polymer, the emission band shape and its time evolution indicate that the major part of the fluorescence originates from disorder induced luminescent sites. These results indicate that the spectroscopic properties of films of π-conjugated polymer critically depend on parameters such as density of defects and excited state interchain interaction energy.},

None of the prominently used DFT approaches show these properties: the optimized effective potential VXC based ab initio dft does. A local, range-separated hybrid potential cam-QTP-00 is introduced as the basis for a “consistent”KS DFT approach. The computed VIPs as the negative of KS eigenvalue have a mean absolute error of 0.8 eV for an extensive set of molecule\&apos;s electron ionizations, including the core. Barrier heights, equilibrium geometries, and magnetic properties obtained from the potential are in good agreement with experiment.

A short introduction is given in § 1. In § 2 it is shown that one quantum of light absorbed by the photo-sensitive material in the eye suffices to give rise to the perception of light. In § 3 some relations are derived that are used in the discussions in § 4 and § 5. In § 4 and § 5 the attention is drawn to the statistical fluctuations in the numbers of quanta perceived and their relation to the limits of differential sensitivity and visual acuity of the eye. It is shown that the limits calculated in this way coincide surprisingly well with the limits actually observed. In § 6 some evidence is presented for the conception that the sensory cells (rods and cones) act in the same way as counters of light-quanta, the more complicated electrical response of single nerve fibers in the optic nerve being caused by the interaction of nerve-cells.},

	abstract = {The vertical transition energies for the 1s ionization potential and the core-excited 1s → π* and 1s → 3s, 3p, 3d Rydberg states as well as selected n = 4 Rydberg species of acetylene and ethylene are calculated employing a basis of 72 (C2 H2) and 76 (C2 H4) contracted gaussian AO's respectively in a large-scale ab initio MRD-CI treatment. The dependence of the calculated results on the size of the \{AO\} basis and on scaling the valence and inner shells is discussed, and a direct comparison between the localized and delocalized \{CI\} treatments for the 1s ionization potential of ethylene is undertaken. In general very good agreement is obtained between calculation and experiment with respect to both energies and intensities of peaks which have been observed in electron impact and synchrotron radiation work, although several modifications in the assignment of the experimental findings are suggested on the basis of the present computations. The shake-up states possessing the same symmetry as the core-ionized species are also calculated, whereby the lowest such states (1s−1, π → π*) in \{C2\} \{H2\} and \{C2\} \{H4\} are found to be in the 6–7 eV region above the K edge. All calculated shake-up data match well with the obsion and \{CH\} stretching modes in ethylene and associated Franck—Condon factors for 1B3u(1s → π*) — X 1Ag transitions show unambiguously that the observed vibrational structure in this ethylene band system corresponds to a progression in the \{CH\} stretching vibration.},

	abstract = {Electronic wavefunctions that describe molecules in the full optimized reaction space (FORS) are multiconfigurational wavefunctions which are invariant under non-singular linear transformations of the occupied molecular orbitals. They offer therefore a considerably wider scope for orbital interpretations than the single-configuration Hartree-Fock approximation. For example they can be analyzed in terms of natural MOs and in terms of localized MOs. The latter turn out to be remarkably atomic in character and a new localization procedure can be formulated which yields atom-adapted molecular orbitals. These have the character of minimal-basis-set AOs that are optimally adapted to the molecular environment and furnish an unambigious atomic population analysis. On the other hand, chemically adapted molecular orbitals can be defined by an appropriate compromise between natural orbitals and localized orbitals. The freedom to use, as configuration-generating molecular orbitals, atom-adapted FORS MOs as well as chemically adapted FORS MOs makes FORS wavefunctions particularly suitable for chemical interpretations. The ensuing analysis establishes the minimal basis set (in molecule-adapted form) as a theoretically sound concept for the understanding of accurate molecular wavefunctions. An illustrative example is discussed.},

In contrast to these expectations, we demonstrate that oxygen in nucleobases adsorbed on graphene with π-π stacking interaction can clearly alter the electric current even in water at room temperature. This property allows us to devise the strategies employing graphene as material of choice in bio-sensorics, bio-chips.},

	abstract = {In order to improve the convergence of selected CIs it is crucial to define correlation-adapted virtual MOs. In the spirit of the frozen natural orbital method (diagonalization of the virtual MO block of the one-electron density matrix) the present paper proposes an inexpensive determination of that part of the density matrix to the M{\o}ller-Plesset second-order level. The superiority of the first eigenvectors of that matrix over the canonical MOs appears in their ability to concentrate significantly the correlation energy, as appears from test calculations on HF, H2O, N2, for which full CI results are available. The amount of correlation obtained from complete active space CIs involving one to five MOs is multiplied by a factor 1.5 to 2 in HF and H2O. In selected CIs, using the CIPSI algorithm, the number of determinants required to obtain a given percent of the correlation energy is reduced by a factor from 2 to 5. The procedure may be applied with similar results after a preliminary definition of valence virtual MOs through CASSCF or more approximate procedures, concerning then only non-valence MOs and the dynamical correlation. Through this partition of the virtual subspace, perturbation divergences are avoided even for stretched bonds. The results on N2 in a large basis set are specially convincing.},

	abstract = {The problem of finding an effective minimal atomic basis that spans the exact occupied wavefunctions of a mean-field theory at a given molecular geometry, which has a number of special properties, is studied and a new general procedure is developed that (1) solves for a raw minimal set of strongly atom-centered functions—products of spherical harmonics and molecule-optimized radial parts—that approximately span the occupied molecular wavefunctions and minimize the sum of their energies, (2) uses projection operators to get a new set of deformed atom-centered functions that exactly span the occupied space and fall into core and valence subsets, (3) applies a new zero-bond-dipole orthogonalization scheme to the core-orthogonalized valence subset so that for each two-center product of these functions the projection of its dipole moment along the line going through the two centers is zero. The resulting effective minimal atomic basis is intrinsic to the molecular problem and does not need a free-atoms input. Some interesting features of the zero-bond-dipole orthogonalization are showing up in the atomic population analysis of a diverse set of molecules. The new procedure may be useful for the interpretation of electronic structure, for the construction of model Hamiltonians in terms of transferable molecular integrals, and for the definition of active valence space in the treatment of electron correlation. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {A tris(pyrazolyl)hydroborate triphenylmethylthiolate Cu(II) model complex (1) that reproduces structural and spectroscopic features of active sites of blue Cu proteins is characterized using low-temperature absorption, magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), X-ray absorption (XAS), and resonance Raman (rR) spectroscopies combined with DFT calculations to define its electronic structure. The electronic structure of 1 is further related to the oxidized Cu site in plastocyanin. The key spectral differences relative to plastocyanin include an increase in the intensity of the S pπ ? Cu CT band and a decrease in the absorption intensity at ?450 nm. The energies of d ? d transitions in 1 decrease relative to plastocyanin, which reflects the more tetrahedral geometry of 1. S K-edge XAS measurements demonstrate a more covalent thiolate interaction in the HOMO of 1 (52\% S p) than in plastocyanin (38\% S p). The effects of the high thiolate covalency on the absorption and Raman spectral features for 1 are evaluated. Additional changes in the absorption spectrum of 1 relative to plastocyanin in the ?450 nm and the near-infrared regions are due to differences in the electronic structure of the nitrogen ligands associated with the change from imidazole to pyrazole. Finally, XAS measurements at the Cu L- and K-edges indicate that the effective nuclear charge of Cu in 1 is higher than in plastocyanin, which likely results from misdirection of the ligating orbitals in the constrained tris(pyrazolyl)hydroborate ligand system. This reduces the donor interaction of this ligand with the copper which increases the covalency of the thiolate?Cu bond and can contribute to the electron-transfer properties of the blue copper site.},

	abstract = {Up till now, there has been a significant disagreement between theory and experiment regarding hydrogen bond lengths in Watson−Crick base pairs. To investigate the possible sources of this discrepancy, we have studied numerous model systems for adenine−thymine (AT) and guanine−cytosine (GC) base pairs at various levels (i.e., BP86, PW91, and BLYP) of nonlocal density functional theory (DFT) in combination with different Slater-type orbital (STO) basis sets. Best agreement with available gas-phase experimental A−T and G−C bond enthalpies (−12.1 and −21.0 kcal/mol) is obtained at the BP86/TZ2P level, which (for 298 K) yields −11.8 and −23.8 kcal/mol. However, the computed hydrogen bond lengths show again the notorious discrepancy with experimental values. The origin of this discrepancy is not the use of the plain nucleic bases as models for nucleotides:  the disagreement with experiment remains no matter if we use hydrogen, methyl, deoxyribose, or 5‘-deoxyribose monophosphate as the substituents at N9 and N1 of the purine and pyrimidine bases, respectively. Even the BP86/DZP geometry of the Watson−Crick-type dimer of deoxyadenylyl-3‘,5‘-deoxyuridine including one Na+ ion (with 123 atoms our largest model for sodium adenylyl-3‘,5‘-uridine hexahydrate, the crystal of which had been studied experimentally with the use of X-ray diffraction) still shows this disagreement with experiment. The source of the divergence turns out to be the molecular environment (water, sugar hydroxyl groups, counterions) of the base pairs in the crystals studied experimentally. This has been missing, so far, in all theoretical models. After we had incorporated the major elements of this environment in our model systems, excellent agreement between our BP86/TZ2P geometries and the X-ray crystal structures was achieved.},

The consequences of 3d-spin–orbit coupling and of 3d systems in symmetries lower than cubic are discussed. The second part of the paper gives a short overview of all X-ray spectroscopies, where the focus is on the multiplet aspects of those spectroscopies and on the various configurations that play a role in combined spectroscopies such as resonant photoemission, resonant X-ray emission and coincidence spectroscopy. The review is concluded with a section that gives an overview of the use of multiplet theory for 3d coordination compounds.

The excited state density functional is recast as a Kohn?Sham functional, which is further simplified by an adiabatic approximation of the exchange-correlation functional. Under the adiabatic approximation, the minimization of the excited state Kohn?Sham functional is shown to be equivalent to a ground state DFT computation augmented with orthogonality constraints with respect to the ground state Kohn?Sham determinant. An algorithm for the optimization of the energy subject to orthogonality constraints, which does not suffer from variational collapse, is described and implemented. A benchmark test set containing 28 organic molecules ( Schreiber, M. J. Chem. Phys. 2008, 128, 134110 ) was used to assess the quality of the excitation energies obtained. Two novel approaches to spin-adapt the resulting excitation energies are discussed and found to provide results with error metrics similar to those of time-dependent DFT. Similarities and differences with respect to other time-independent DFT approaches are highlighted and some of the advantages of our scheme?including the ability to correctly describe charge-transfer excitations?are critically assessed.},

The variational collapse of the core excited state is prevented by maintaining a singly occupied core orbital using an overlap criterion called the maximum overlap method. When applied to a wide range of small organic molecules, the resulting core excitation energies are not systematically underestimated as observed in time-dependent density functional theory and agree well with experiment. The accuracy of this approach for core excited states is illustrated by the calculation of the pre-edge features in x-ray absorption spectra of plastocyanin, which shows that accurate results can be achieved with Δ self-consistent-field calculations when used in conjunction with uncontracted basis functions.},

The applications show that the quasiatomic orbitals deviate from the minimal-basis SCF orbitals of the free atoms by only very small deformations and that the latter arise mainly from bonded neighbor atoms. The Mulliken population analysis in terms of the quasiatomic minimal-basis orbitals leads to a quantum mechanical interpretation of small-ring strain in terms of antibonding encroachments of localized molecular-orbitals and identifies the origin of the bond-stretch isomerization in Si4H6.Si4H6.{\textless}math overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00004.gif"{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}Si{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}4{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}H{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}6{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}.{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} In the virtual SCF/DFT orbital space, the method places the qualitative notion of virtual valence orbitals on a firm basis and provides an unambiguous ab initio identification of the frontier orbitals.},

Instead of using the aufbau principle, the algorithm maximizes the overlap between the occupied orbitals on successive SCF iterations. This prevents variational collapse to the ground state and guides the SCF process toward the nearest, rather than the lowest energy, solution. The resulting excited-state solutions can be treated in the same way as the ground-state solution and, in particular, derivatives of excited-state energies can be computed using ground-state code. We assess the performance of our method by applying it to a variety of excited-state problems including the calculation of excitation energies, charge-transfer states, and excited-state properties.},

	abstract = {We report the development of a set of excited-state analysis tools that are based on the construction of an effective exciton wavefunction and its statistical analysis in terms of spatial multipole moments. This construction does not only enable the quantification of the spatial location and compactness of the individual hole and electron densities but also correlation phenomena can be analyzed, which makes this procedure particularly useful when excitonic or charge-resonance effects are of interest. The methods are first applied to bianthryl with a focus on elucidating charge–resonance interactions. It is shown how these derive from anticorrelations between the electron and hole quasiparticles, and it is discussed how the resulting variations in state characters affect the excited-state absorption spectrum. As a second example, cytosine is chosen. It is illustrated how the various descriptors vary for valence, Rydberg, and core-excited states, and the possibility of using this information for an automatic characterization of state characters is discussed. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {The problem of finding an effective minimal atomic basis that spans the exact occupied wavefunctions of a mean-field theory at a given molecular geometry, which has a number of special properties, is studied and a new general procedure is developed that (1) solves for a raw minimal set of strongly atom-centered functions—products of spherical harmonics and molecule-optimized radial parts—that approximately span the occupied molecular wavefunctions and minimize the sum of their energies, (2) uses projection operators to get a new set of deformed atom-centered functions that exactly span the occupied space and fall into core and valence subsets, (3) applies a new zero-bond-dipole orthogonalization scheme to the core-orthogonalized valence subset so that for each two-center product of these functions the projection of its dipole moment along the line going through the two centers is zero. The resulting effective minimal atomic basis is intrinsic to the molecular problem and does not need a free-atoms input. Some interesting features of the zero-bond-dipole orthogonalization are showing up in the atomic population analysis of a diverse set of molecules. The new procedure may be useful for the interpretation of electronic structure, for the construction of model Hamiltonians in terms of transferable molecular integrals, and for the definition of active valence space in the treatment of electron correlation. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The electronic environment of nitrogen in nucleic acid bases, nucleotides, polynucleotides and DNA has been studied, for the first time using X-Ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy (XANES). Generally, the spectra of these complex molecules consist of low energy bands corresponding to 1s → π∗ transitions and high energy bands corresponding to 1s → σ∗ transition, as illustrated using several nitrogen model compounds. The 1s → π∗ transitions show particular sensitivity to the chemical environment of the nitrogen. Oxygen substitution on ring carbon atoms generally results in a significant blue shift of the lowest 1s → π∗ bands while halogen substitution results in a small blue shift. These observations illustrate the significance of the disturbance of the aromatic ring system produced by exocyclic carbonyl groups. Direct substitution on the nitrogen frequently results in significant spectral perturbations. Differences between the spectra of the polynucleotides and the sums of spectra of the individual nucleotides point to the effects of hydrogen-bonding in complementary double-helix structures. The XANES spectrum of a DNA sample with a known ratio of the polynucleotides is equivalent to the weighted sum of the spectra of individual polynucleotides, indicating that the difference in base stacking interactions produces negligible spectral effects. The variability of nitrogen K-edge spectra in these samples and in protein may be useful for chemically specific imaging using X-ray microscopes.},

Also, the correct 1/R asymptotic behavior of CT states with respect to a distance coordinate R between the separated charges of the CT state is not reproduced by TDDFT employing these xc-functionals. Here, we demonstrate by analysis of the TDDFT equations that the first failure is due to the self-interaction error in the orbital energies from the ground-state DFT calculation, while the latter is a similar self-interaction error in TDDFT arising through the electron transfer in the CT state. Possible correction schemes, such as inclusion of exact Hartree−Fock or exact Kohn−Sham exchange, as well as aspects of the exact xc-functional are discussed in this context. Furthermore, a practical approach is proposed which combines the benefits of TDDFT and configuration interaction singles (CIS) and which does not suffer from electron-transfer self-interaction. The latter approach is applied to a (1,4)-phenylene-linked zincbacteriochlorin−bacteriochlorin complex and to a bacteriochlorophyll−spheroidene complex, in which CT states may play important roles in energy and electron-transfer processes. The errors of TDDFT alone for the CT states are demonstrated, and reasonable estimates for the true excitation energies of these states are given.},

	abstract = {We present a first-principles study on the ground and excited electronic states of a carotenoid-porphyrin-C60 molecular triad. In addition, we illustrate a method for using DFT-based wave functions and densities to simulate complicated charge-transfer dynamics. Since fast and efficient calculations of charge-transfer excitations are required to understand these systems, we introduce a simple DFT-based method for calculating total energy differences between ground and excited states. To justify the procedure, we argue that some charge-transfer excitations are asympototically ground-state properties of the separated systems. Further justification is provided from numerical experiments on separated alkali atoms. The donor-chromophore-acceptor system studied here can absorb and store light energy for several hundreds of nanoseconds. Our density-functional calculations show that the triad can possess a dipole moment of 171 D in a charge-separated state. The charge-transfer energy technique is used to obtain the energies of the excited states. The charge separated excited states with a large dipole moment will create large polarization of the solvent. We use a model to estimate the stabilization of the excited-state energies in the presence of polarization. The calculated excited-state energies are further used to calculate the Einstein?s A and B coefficients for this molecular system. We use these transition rates in a kinetic Monte-Carlo simulation to examine the electronic excitations and possible charging of the molecule. Our calculations show that the solvent polarization plays a crucial role in reordering the excited-state energies and thereby in the charge-separation process.},

Furthermore, the utility of a wide array of additional analysis methods is highlighted. Five molecules with diverse excited state characteristics are chosen for these tasks: pyridine as a prototypical small heteroaromatic molecule, a model system of six neon atoms to study charge resonance effects, hexatriene in its neutral and radical cation forms to exemplify the cases of double excitations and spin-polarization, respectively, and a model iridium complex as a representative metal organic compound. Using these examples a number of phenomena, which are at first sight unexpected, are highlighted and their physical significance is discussed.

The QUAOs persist and can be followed throughout the reaction path. The kinetic bond orders and the orbital populations of the QUAOs quantitatively reveal the changes of the bonding interactions along the reaction path. At the transition state the OO bond is broken, and the molecule becomes a biradical. After the transition state the reaction path bifurcates. The minimum energy path gently descends from the transition state via a valley–ridge inflection point to a second saddle point, from which two new minimum energy paths lead to two equivalent formaldehyde dimers. The CC bond breaks, and the π-bonds of the formaldehyde fragments form in close vicinity of the second saddle point. The changes of the interactions in this region are elucidated by the analysis of the rearrangements of the QUAOs.},

Previously unobserved fine structure is resolved. The spectra of both molecules are characterized by multielectron excitations 8–14 eV above the L2 threshold energy, broad valence-shell absorption features 5–8 eV below the L2 edge, and many narrower Rydberg excitations 0–5 eV below the L2 edge. Comparison of the H2S and D2S spectra allows the identification of transitions which include vibrational excitation, due to the isotopic dependence of vibrational energies.

Results show that the twofold degeneracy of the sulfur 2p3/2 core level is removed by the molecular field, with a resulting splitting of 115 meV for the higher-energy core-excited Rydberg states. The energies of the higher Rydberg states were well described by the Rydberg formula with the quantum defects δp=1.63 and δd=0.32.

Science 2004, 304, 995). This controversial conclusion was primarily based on comparison between experimental and calculated X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) using computer-generated ice-like 11-molecule clusters. Here we present calculations which conclusively show that when hydrogen-bonding configurations are chosen randomly, the calculated XAS does not reproduce the experimental XAS regardless of the bonding model employed (i.e., rings and chains vs tetrahedral). Furthermore, we also present an analysis of a recently introduced asymmetric water potential (Soper, A. K. J. Phys.:  Condens. Matter 2005, 17, S3273), which is representative of the rings and chains structure, and make comparisons with the standard SPC/E potential, which represents the locally tetrahedral structure. We find that the calculated XAS from both potentials is inconsistent with the experimental XAS. However, we also show the calculated electric field distribution from the rings and chains structure is strongly bimodal and highly inconsistent with the experimental Raman spectrum, thus casting serious doubt on the validity of the rings and chains model for liquid water.},

In the internal space, oriented quasi-atomic orbitals and split-localized molecular orbitals are determined by new, fast localization methods. The density matrix between the oriented quasi-atomic orbitals as well as the locations of the split-localized orbitals exhibit atomic populations and inter-atomic bonding patterns. A correlation-adapted quasi-atomic basis is determined in the external orbital space. The general formulations are specified in detail for Hartree-Fock wave functions.

A comparative analysis shows that the majority of molecules in liquid water in our simulation exhibit hydrogen-bonding energy patterns similar to those in ice and retain the four-fold coordination with only moderately distorted tetrahedral configurations. Although this result indicates that the traditional description of liquid water is fundamentally correct, our study also demonstrates that for a significant fraction of molecules the hydrogen-bonding environments are highly asymmetric with extremely weak and distorted bonds.},

	abstract = {X-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray Raman scattering were used to probe the molecular arrangement in the first coordination shell of liquid water. The local structure is characterized by comparison with bulk and surface of ordinary hexagonal ice Ih and with calculated spectra. Most molecules in liquid water are in two hydrogen–bonded configurations with one strong donor and one strong acceptor hydrogen bond in contrast to the four hydrogen–bonded tetrahedral structure in ice. Upon heating from 25°C to 90°C, 5 to 10\% of the molecules change from tetrahedral environments to two hydrogen–bonded configurations. Our findings are consistent with neutron and x-ray diffraction data, and combining the results sets a strong limit for possible local structure distributions in liquid water. Serious discrepancies with structures based on current molecular dynamics simulations are observed.
X-ray absorption and Raman scattering reveal that most of the molecules in liquid water form only one strong hydrogen bond, like those on the surface of ice.

	abstract = {The electron positive boron atom usually does not contribute to the frontier orbitals for several lower-lying electronic transitions, and thus is ideal to serve as a hub for the spiro linker of light-emitting molecules, such that the electron donor (HOMO) and acceptor (LUMO) moieties can be spatially separated with orthogonal orientation. On this basis, we prepared a series of novel boron complexes bearing electron deficient pyridyl pyrrolide and electron donating phenylcarbazolyl fragments or triphenylamine. The new boron complexes show strong solvent-polarity dependent charge-transfer emission accompanied by a small, non-negligible normal emission. The slim orbital overlap between HOMO and LUMO and hence the lack of electron correlation lead to a significant reduction of the energy gap between the lowest lying singlet and triplet excited states (ΔET-S) and thereby the generation of thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF).},

	abstract = {The theoretical simulation of X-ray absorption spectra is in general a challenging task. However, for small and medium-sized organic molecules, the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme (ADC) for the polarization operator in combination with the core–valence separation approximation (CVS) has proven to yield core-excitation energies and transition moments with almost quantitative accuracy allowing for reliable construction of X-ray absorption spectra. Still, to understand core-excitation processes in detail, it is not sufficient to only compute energies, but also properties like static dipole moments and state densities are important as they provide deeper insight into the nature of core-excited states. Here, we present for the first time an implementation of the intermediate state representation (ISR) approach in combination with the CVS approximation (CVS-ISR), which gives, in combination with the CVS-ADC method, direct access to core-excited state properties. The performance of the CVS-ADC/CVS-ISR approach is demonstrated by means of small- and medium-sized organic molecules. Besides the calculation of core-excited state dipole moments, advanced analyses of core-excited state densities are performed using descriptors like exciton sizes and distances. Plotting electron and hole densities helps to determine the character of the state, and in particular, the investigation of detachment/attachment densities provides information about orbital relaxation effects that are crucial for understanding core excitations.},

	abstract = {Red fluorescent molecules suffer from large, non-radiative internal conversion rates (kIC) governed by the energy gap law. To design efficient red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), a large fluorescence rate (kF) as well as a small energy difference between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states (ΔEST) is necessary. Herein, we demonstrated that increasing the distance between donor (D) and acceptor (A) in intramolecular-charge-transfer molecules is a promising strategy for simultaneously achieving small ΔEST and large kF. Four D-Ph-A-Ph-D-type molecules with an anthraquinone acceptor, phenyl (Ph) bridge, and various donors were designed, synthesized, and compared with corresponding D-A-D-type molecules. Yellow to red TADF was observed from all of them. The kF and ΔEST values determined from the measurements of quantum yield and lifetime of the fluorescence and TADF components are in good agreement with those predicted by corrected time-dependent density functional theory and are approximatively proportional to the square of the cosine of the theoretical twisting angles between each subunit. However, the introduction of a Ph-bridge was found to enhance kF without increasing ΔEST. Molecular simulation revealed a twisting and stretching motion of the N–C bond in the D-A-type molecules, which is thought to lower ΔEST and kF but raise kIC, that was experimentally confirmed in both solution and doped film. OLEDs containing D-Ph-A-Ph-D-type molecules with diphenylamine and bis(4-biphenyl)amine donors demonstrated maximum external quantum efficiencies of 12.5\% and 9.0\% with emission peaks at 624 and 637 nm, respectively.},

	abstract = {X-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray Raman scattering were used to probe the molecular arrangement in the first coordination shell of liquid water. The local structure is characterized by comparison with bulk and surface of ordinary hexagonal ice Ih and with calculated spectra. Most molecules in liquid water are in two hydrogen–bonded configurations with one strong donor and one strong acceptor hydrogen bond in contrast to the four hydrogen–bonded tetrahedral structure in ice. Upon heating from 25°C to 90°C, 5 to 10\% of the molecules change from tetrahedral environments to two hydrogen–bonded configurations. Our findings are consistent with neutron and x-ray diffraction data, and combining the results sets a strong limit for possible local structure distributions in liquid water. Serious discrepancies with structures based on current molecular dynamics simulations are observed.},

Analysis of the data over the temperature range 251 to 288 kelvin (–22° to +15°C) yields a value of 1.5 ± 0.5 kilocalories per mole for the average thermal energy required to effect an observable rearrangement between the fully coordinated (“ice-like”) and distorted (“broken-donor”) local hydrogen-bonding configurations responsible for the pre-edge and post-edge features, respectively. This energy equals the latent heat of melting of ice with hexagonal symmetry (ice Ih) and is consistent with the distribution of hydrogen bond strengths obtained for the “overstructured” ST2 model of water.
X-ray absorption data show that although most hydrogen bonds in water are abnormal, only about one-fourth are broken; the remainder are just bent or distorted.

	abstract = {A diagonalisation procedure of the Foldy-Wouthuysen type is considered for the single-electron Dirac Hamiltonian as a basis for many-body applications. A modified procedure is suggested. In the diagonalisation procedure the Dirac equation is completely decoupled into two equations of the Pauli type. The expressions for positive- and negative-energy projection operators in the transformed basis are then trivial and, by performing the inverse transformation, projection operators for Dirac functions are obtained. Applying a similar transformation to the two-electron Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian leads to a diagonalised single-electron part and a non-diagonal two-electron interaction. In principle, the effect of the exchange of virtual, transverse photons (Breit interactions) can also be included in the electron-electron interaction and transformed in a similar way. It is indicated how a diagonalisation procedure of this kind can be used as a basis for relativistic many-body calculations in the coupled cluster formulation in analogy with the corresponding non-relativistic procedure.},

Here we describe how these approximations can be replaced by efficient ab initio models including a many-pole model of the self-energy, inelastic losses and multiple-electron excitations; a linear response approach for the core hole; and a Lanczos approach for Debye-Waller effects. We also discuss the implementation of these models and software improvements within the FEFF9 code, together with a number of examples.},

	abstract = {The x-ray-absorption near-edge structure of gas-phase H2S, hydrogen sulfide, and D2S, deuterium sulfide, at the sulfur L2,3 ionization thresholds has been measured using synchrotron radiation with high-energy resolution from the SX700/II soft-x-ray monochromator at the Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gessellschaft f{\"u}r Synchrotronstrahlung m.b.H. Previously unobserved fine structure is resolved. The spectra of both molecules are characterized by multielectron excitations 8–14 eV above the L2 threshold energy, broad valence-shell absorption features 5–8 eV below the L2 edge, and many narrower Rydberg excitations 0–5 eV below the L2 edge. Comparison of the H2S and D2S spectra allows the identification of transitions which include vibrational excitation, due to the isotopic dependence of vibrational energies. For the (2p)-1 core-excited Rydberg states, a least-squares analysis was employed, which deconvoluted the core-level and excited-orbital splittings. Results show that the twofold degeneracy of the sulfur 2p3/2 core level is removed by the molecular field, with a resulting splitting of 115 meV for the higher-energy core-excited Rydberg states. The energies of the higher Rydberg states were well described by the Rydberg formula with the quantum defects δp=1.63 and δd=0.32. Fine structure was resolved in the transitions to the dissociative (2p)-1 core-excited valence-shell states. The regular spacing and isotopic dependence of this structure clearly identifies it as a vibrational progression.},

	abstract = {The electron positive boron atom usually does not contribute to the frontier orbitals for several lower-lying electronic transitions, and thus is ideal to serve as a hub for the spiro linker of light-emitting molecules, such that the electron donor (HOMO) and acceptor (LUMO) moieties can be spatially separated with orthogonal orientation. On this basis, we prepared a series of novel boron complexes bearing electron deficient pyridyl pyrrolide and electron donating phenylcarbazolyl fragments or triphenylamine. The new boron complexes show strong solvent-polarity dependent charge-transfer emission accompanied by a small, non-negligible normal emission. The slim orbital overlap between HOMO and LUMO and hence the lack of electron correlation lead to a significant reduction of the energy gap between the lowest lying singlet and triplet excited states (ΔET-S) and thereby the generation of thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF).},

	abstract = {A series of mononuclear V(V), V(IV) and V(III) complexes were investigated by V L-edge near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. The spectra show significant sensitivity to the vanadium oxidation state and the coordination environment surrounding the vanadium center. The L-edge spectra are interpreted with the aid of the recently developed Density Functional Theory/Restricted Open Shell Configuration Interaction Singles (DFT/ROCIS) method. This method is calibrated for the prediction of vanadium L-edges with different hybrid density functionals and basis sets. For the B3LYP/def2-TZVP(-f) and BHLYP/def2-TZVP(-f) functional/basis-set combinations, good to excellent agreement between calculated and experimental spectra is obtained. A treatment of the spin-orbit coupling interaction to all orders is achieved by quasi-degenerate perturbation theory (QDPT), in conjunction with DFT/ROCIS for the calculation of the molecular multiplets while accounting for dynamic correlation and anisotropic covalency. The physical origin of the observed spectral features is discussed qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of spin multiplicities, magnetic sublevels and individual 2p to 3d core level excitations. This investigation is an important prerequisite for future applications of the DFT/ROCIS method to vanadium L-edge absorption spectroscopy and vanadium-based heterogeneous catalysts.},

The algorithm is very fast, limited only by diagonalization of two matrices with dimension the size of the number of virtual orbitals. Furthermore, we require no more than quadratic (in the number of electrons) storage. The basic premise behind our algorithm is that one can decompose any given atomic-orbital (AO) vector space as a minimal basis space (which includes the occupied and valence virtual spaces) and a hard-virtual (HV) space (which includes everything else). The valence virtual space localizes easily with standard methods, while the hard-virtual space is constructed to be atom centered and automatically local. The orbitals presented here may be computed almost as quickly as projecting the AO basis onto the virtual space and are almost as local (according to orbital variance), while our orbitals are orthonormal (rather than redundant and nonorthogonal). We expect this algorithm to find use in local-correlation methods.},

Molecular building units are selected and bound in a specific pattern to allow for increase in emission performance, also due to TADF. Using time-dependent density functional theory, the relevant singlet–singlet and triplet-singlet energy gaps corresponding to absorption or emission transitions of the compounds are computed to simulate the electroluminescent spectrum. The results are analyzed in depth and relations between some spectral and structural properties are proposed. The best suited molecules are delineated as potential OLED building blocks.

	abstract = {Limitations imposed by spin statistics governing exciton formation has meant that most efficient organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have relied upon complexes containing heavy metals. This can be overcome by exploiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), which has opened the opportunity to design emitters composed only of lighter, more abundant elements. For these complexes, charge-transfer excitations play a central role, meaning that modeling their properties within the framework of time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) is challenging. Herein, two computational approaches to rectify this are explored. First is an analysis based on the overlap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). This qualitative approach provides a satisfactory and very computationally efficient prediction of the energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states, crucial for TADF. In the second approach, the excited-state properties are explicitly calculated using TD-DFT by optimizing the range separation parameter within range-corrected functionals. This yields quantitative agreement with experimental results and can therefore be used to rationalize the photophysical properties of these complexes.},

The results obtained with this method in terms of energies and bond lengths for the first three electronic states and the corresponding minimum energy conical intersections between potential energy surfaces compare very well with CASSCF results and suggest further testing of the method for RASSCF calculations.},

This way, controllable accuracy and smooth convergence towards the exact result are obtained in the framework of an a posteriori approximation scheme. For the representation of the occupied space a new set of local orbitals is presented with the size of a minimal basis set. This set is atom centered, is nonorthogonal, and has shapes which are fairly independent of the details of the molecular system of interest. Two slightly different versions of combined local coupled cluster and perturbation theory equations are considered. In the limit both converge to the untruncated CCSD result. Benchmark calculations for four systems (heptane, serine, water hexamer, and oxadiazole-2-oxide) are carried out, and decay of the amplitudes, truncation error, and convergence towards the exact CCSD result are analyzed.},

Here we describe how these approximations can be replaced by efficient ab initio models including a many-pole model of the self-energy, inelastic losses and multiple-electron excitations; a linear response approach for the core hole; and a Lanczos approach for Debye-Waller effects. We also discuss the implementation of these models and software improvements within the FEFF9 code, together with a number of examples.},

	abstract = {A spin-adapted configuration interaction with singles method that is based on a restricted open-shell reference function (ROCIS) with general total spin S is presented. All excited configuration state functions (CSFs) are generated with the aid of a spin-free second quantization formalism that only leads to CSFs within the first order interacting space. By virtue of the CSF construction, the formalism involves higher than singly excited determinants but not higher than singly excited configurations. Matrix elements between CSFs are evaluated on the basis of commutator relationships using a symbolic algebra program. The final equations were, however, hand-coded in order to maximize performance. The method can be applied to fairly large systems with more than 100 atoms in reasonable wall-clock times and also parallelizes well. Test calculations demonstrate that the approach is far superior to UHF-based configuration interaction with single excitations but necessarily falls somewhat short of quantitative accuracy due to the lack of dynamic correlation contributions. In order to implicitly account for dynamic correlation in a crude way, the program optionally allows for the use of Kohn?Sham orbitals in combination with a modest downscaling of two-electron integrals (DFT/ROCIS). All two-electron integrals of Kohn?Sham orbitals that appear in the Hamiltonian matrix are reduced by a total of three scaling parameters that are suitable for a wide range of molecules. Test calculations on open-shell organic radicals as well as transition metal complexes demonstrate the wide applicability of the method and its ability to calculate the electronic spectra of large molecular systems.},

Calculations on a set of small carbon-containing molecules and chemisorbed species show that this provides a viable option for obtaining excitation energies and oscillator strengths close to the experimental accuracy of core-valence transitions. Systematic variations in energy positions and intensities of the different spectra in the test series have been investigated, and comparison is made with respect to the static exchange-, self-consistent-field, and explicit electron-correlation methods. The choice between standard exchange-correlation functionals is shown to be of little consequence for the valence resonant, here π*, parts of the x-ray-absorption spectra, while the long-range behavior of presently available functionals is found not to be completely satisfactory for Rydberg-like transitions. Implementing a basis set augmentation technique, one finds that DFT methods still account well for most of the salient features in the near-edge x-ray-absorption spectra, save for the multielectron transitions in the near continuum, and for some loss of Rydberg structure. For clusters modeling surface adsorbates, the DFT transition potential method reproduces well the spectral compression and intensity reduction for the valence level absorption compared to the free phase, provided fairly large clusters are taken into account. While for near-edge x-ray-absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectra of free molecules the DFT-TP and Hartree-Fock/static exchange methods have complementary advantages, the DFT-TP method is clearly to be preferred when using clusters to simulate NEXAFS spectra of surface adsorbates.},

The systematic differences observed between the zwitterionic and un-ionized forms of amino acids arise directly from the structural difference (−NH2 vs −NH3+), which leads to a change in the degree of Rydberg−valence mixing. Further change arises from quenching of this Rydberg character in the spectra of condensed amino acids.

	abstract = {It was recently reported that external quantum efficiency in organic LEDs can be substantially enhanced when triplet excitons are harvested through upconversion by E-type delayed fluorescence in materials with small singlet–triplet energy gap ΔEST, based on donor–acceptor (DA) chromophores. Furthermore, organic solar cells (OSCs) might profit from such materials in order to reduce recombination losses. However, targeted design rules for such materials are missing up to now. In this paper, we follow a facile (TD-)DFT-based computational design concept by engineering the fragment frontier orbitals in DA systems. The calculations show that optimized systems with very small ΔEST in the range of kT can be achieved by balancing the energetic offset between fragment MOs as well as through the nature of the DA connector. Application in OLED will additionally require small non-radiative rates, which recommends large bandgap materials. Utilization in polymeric DA systems with small ΔEST in OSCs requires the full exploration of the chain length dependence of the respective oligomers.},

	abstract = {Vitamin D is one of the oldest hormones that have been made in the earliest life forms for over 750 million years. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, and most plants and animals that are exposed to sunlight have the capacity to make vitamin D. Vitamin D is critically important for the development, growth, and maintenance of a healthy skeleton from birth until death. The major function of vitamin D is to maintain calcium homeostasis. It accomplishes this by increasing the efficiency of the intestine to absorb dietary calcium. When there is inadequate calcium in the diet to satisfy the body's calcium requirement, vitamin D communicates to the osteoblasts that signal osteoclast precursors to mature and dissolve the calcium stored in the bone. Vitamin D is metabolized in the liver and then in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)(2)D]. 1,25(OH)(2)D receptors (VDR) are present not only in the intestine and bone, but in a wide variety of other tissues, including the brain, heart, stomach, pancreas, activated T and B lymphocytes, skin, gonads, etc. 1,25(OH)(2)D is one of the most potent substances to inhibit proliferation of both normal and hyperproliferative cells and induce them to mature. It is also recognized that a wide variety of tissues, including colon, prostate, breast, and skin have the enzymatic machinery to produce 1,25(OH)(2)D. 1,25(OH)(2)D and its analogs have been developed for treating the hyperproliferative disease psoriasis. Vitamin D deficiency is a major unrecognized health problem. Not only does it cause rickets in children, osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults, but may have long lasting effects. Chronic vitamin D deficiency may have serious adverse consequences, including increased risk of hypertension, multiple sclerosis, cancers of the colon, prostate, breast, and ovary, and type 1 diabetes. There needs to be a better appreciation of the importance of vitamin D for overall health and well being.},

This construction provides an unbiased and direct connection between quantum chemistry and empirical chemical concepts, and can be used, for example, to calculate the nature of bonding in molecules, in chemical terms, from first principles. In particular, we find consistency with electronegativities (χ), C 1s core-level shifts, resonance substituent parameters (σR), Lewis structures, and oxidation states of transition-metal complexes.},

	abstract = {A practical polarization propagator method devised for the treatment of valence electron excitations in atoms and molecules is presented. This method, referred to as (second-order) algebraic-diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)), allows for a theoretical description of single and double excitations consistently through second and first order, respectively, of perturbation theory. The computational scheme is essentially an eigenvalue problem of a Hermitian secular matrix defined with respect to the space of singly and doubly excited configurations. The configuration space is smaller (more compact) than that of comparable configuration interaction (CI) expansions and the method leads to size-consistent results. The performance of the ADC(2) method is tested in exemplary applications to Ne, Ar and CO, where detailed comparison can be made with experiment and previous theoretical results. While the accuracy of the absolute excitation energies is only moderate, a very satisfactory description is obtained for the relative energies and, in particular, for the spectral intensities. Aspects related to the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule and the equivalence of the dipole-length and dipole-velocity forms of the transition moments are discussed. Due to the relatively small computational expense and the possibility of a direct ADC(2) formulation this method should prove particularly useful in applications to large molecules.},

The dependence of the calculated results on the size of the \{AO\} basis and on scaling the valence and inner shells is discussed, and a direct comparison between the localized and delocalized \{CI\} treatments for the 1s ionization potential of ethylene is undertaken. In general very good agreement is obtained between calculation and experiment with respect to both energies and intensities of peaks which have been observed in electron impact and synchrotron radiation work, although several modifications in the assignment of the experimental findings are suggested on the basis of the present computations. The shake-up states possessing the same symmetry as the core-ionized species are also calculated, whereby the lowest such states (1s−1, π → π*) in \{C2\} \{H2\} and \{C2\} \{H4\} are found to be in the 6–7 eV region above the K edge. All calculated shake-up data match well with the obsion and \{CH\} stretching modes in ethylene and associated Franck—Condon factors for 1B3u(1s → π*) — X 1Ag transitions show unambiguously that the observed vibrational structure in this ethylene band system corresponds to a progression in the \{CH\} stretching vibration.},

Both quadrupole and dipole contributions to the spectra have been calculated. We find that good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained by using the BP86 functional with the CP(PPP) basis set on the Fe and TZVP one of the remaining atoms. Inclusion of solvation yields a small improvement in the calculated energies. However, the inclusion of scalar relativistic effects did not yield any improved correlation with experiment.

	abstract = {We describe the implementation of a simple technique to simulate core-level spectra within the Car-Parrinello plane-waves molecular dynamics framework. The x-rayabsorption (XA) spectra are generated using the transition potential technique with the effect of the core hole included through a specifically developed pseudopotential for the core-excited atom. Despite the lack of 1s core orbitals in the pseudopotential treatment, the required transition moments are accurately calculated without reconstruction of the all-electron orbitals. The method is applied to the oxygen XA spectra of water in its various aggregation states, but it is transferable to any first-row element. The computed spectra are compared favorably with the results from all-electron cluster calculations, as well as with experimental data. The periodicity of the plane-wave technique improves the description of condensed phases. The molecular dynamics simulation enables in principle a proper treatment of thermal effects and dynamical averaging in complex systems.},

	abstract = {The effects of intermolecular interactions in the excited state of acene molecules on the singlet–triplet energy difference (ΔEST) were investigated by carrying out ab initio calculations at the SOS-CIS(D0)/aug-cc-pVDZ level. Benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene molecules were employed, and their ΔEST values were compared with those of their respective cofacial excimers. Our theoretical results demonstrate that, upon the formation of excimer, the ΔEST values decrease significantly. By carrying out an excitation energy decomposition, we found that ΔEST, albeit also modulated by the changes in orbital energy difference and Coulomb energy, is dominated by the difference in exchange energy between the singlet and triplet states, with the exchange energy decreasing as the intermolecular interactions become stronger. The natural transition orbital analysis suggests that the decrease in the exchange energy may be caused by the different nature of the hole and electron wave functions of the excimers (antibonding vs bonding), which gives rise to their spatial separation. Furthermore, it was found that the geometry relaxation effects depend on the spin state, thus leading to a further reduction of ΔEST.},

Quasi-classical trajectory calculations, using an accurate full-dimensional potential energy surface, are in accord with and help to elucidate experiment. Experiment and theory find predominant excitation of the fragment bending mode upon hydrogen bond breaking. A minor channel is also observed in which both fragments are in the ground vibrational state and are highly rotationally excited. The theoretical calculations reveal equal probability of bending excitation in the donor and acceptor subunits, which is a result of interchange of donor and acceptor roles. The rotational distributions associated with the major channel, in which one water fragment has one quantum of bend, and the minor channel with both water fragments in the ground vibrational state are calculated and are in agreement with experiment.},

	abstract = {A new method which we refer to as vertical Franck-Condon is proposed to calculate electronic absorption spectra of polyatomic molecules. In accord with the short-time picture of spectroscopy, the excited-state potential energy surface is expanded at the ground-state equilibrium geometry and the focus of the approach is more on the overall shape of the spectrum and the positions of the band maxima, rather than the precise position of the 0-0 lines. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation and the separability of the excited-state potential energy surface along the excited-state normal mode coordinates are assumed. However, the potential surface is not necessarily approximated as harmonic oscillator potentials along the individual normal modes. Instead, depending upon the nature of the potential surface along a particular normal mode, it is treated either in the harmonic approximation or the full one-dimensional potential is considered along this mode. The vertical Franck-Condon approach is applicable therefore even in cases where the excited state potential energy surface is highly anharmonic and the conventional harmonic Franck-Condon approach is inadequate.

	abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses statistical exchange-correlation in the self-consistent field. There are two sides to a self-consistent field calculation: the determination of the potential and the solution of Schr{\"o}dinger's equation for the one-electron problem. The solution of Schr{\"o}dinger's equation has fortunately advanced far enough through the application of the electronic digital computer so that it can be regarded for most purposes as being a standardized technique. The main point of the method of Gaspar, Kohn, and Sham is that they derive the approximate exchange correction from an approximate Hamiltonian for the system by varying the spin-orbitals to minimize the average value of this Hamiltonian for the ground state. The approximate Hamiltonian has many important and valuable features that are described in the chapter.},

An XAS spectrum is composed of two regions, XANES and EXAFS, which provide element-specific information on formal oxidation state and local coordination environment, respectively. For molecules with similar environments, such as a common ligand set, the energy of the absorption edge can be calibrated from standards to obtain the formal oxidation state of unknown compounds. For structurally complex coordination environments, simulated EXAFS spectra obtained from XRD or DFT-modeled structures can be used to ascertain local structural information from an experimental EXAFS spectrum. With fast data acquisition at modern synchrotrons, it is also possible to follow the kinetic transformation of homogeneous compounds under realistic reaction conditions while gaining insight into the structural and electronic changes happening at the metal atom.},

	abstract = {While hybrid functionals are largely responsible for the utility of modern Kohn?Sham density functional theory, they are not without their weaknesses. In the solid state, the slow decay of their nonlocal Hartree?Fock-type exchange makes hybrids computationally demanding and can introduce unphysical effects. Both problems can be remedied by a screened hybrid which uses exact exchange only at short-range. Many molecular properties, in contrast, benefit from the inclusion of long-range exact exchange. Recently, the authors reconciled these two seemingly contradictory requirements by introducing the HISS functional [J. Chem. Phys. 2007, 127, 221103], which uses exact exchange only in the middle range. In this paper, we expand upon our previous work, benchmarking the performance of the HISS functional for several simple properties and applying it to the dissociation of homonuclear diatomic cations and to the polarizability of linear H2 chains to determine the importance of middle-range exact exchange for these systems, which are expected to be sensitive to the asymptotic exchange potential.},

The nature of the excited states arising from one-electron core → π* and core → σ* excitations at different sites on the silylene ring are examined by relating the changes in the spectra of these compounds to differences in their molecular structure. The variations in the intensities of core → π* transitions in these spectra probe the extent of delocalization in the π-electron manifold and, thus, allow us to investigate the nature of π stabilization in heterocycles containing divalent silicon. Low-lying transitions to a π*(Si−N) level observed in all core edge spectra strongly support the existence of π-delocalization in the CC unsaturated silylene. Ab initio calculations are used to confirm spectral assignments.},

Cytosine exhibited characteristic asymmetric and symmetric NH2 stretching signal. The asymmetric stretching signal was missing in the submonolayer region, indicating that the whole molecule was standing upright, with the NH2 group sticking out of the surface. Thymine was also proved to stand upright at surface. Guanine exhibited weakened infrared signals, indicating that the core purine ring was tilted on the surface, with an interaction of NHCO side of the molecule.

	abstract = {Due to the fact that for d6systems there are a number of low-lying ligand field (LF) states the relaxation from excited states of Fe(II) coordination compounds is, in general, a very fast and radiationless process. In Fe(II) spin-crossover systems, however, the zero point energy difference between the two lowest states, namely the low-spin (LS) 1A1 and the high-spin (HS) 5T2 state, is of the order of kBT, and some systems can be converted quantitatively to the HS state well below the thermal transition temperature by irradiating either into MLCT or LF absorption bands of the LS species, with HS→LS relaxation rates as small as 10−6 s−1 at XXX10 K. It is also possible to achieve a light-induced transient population of a HS state in Fe(II) LS compounds, but in this case the HS→LS relaxation rates can be larger than 106 s−1 even at low temperatures. The HS→LS relaxation rates show strong deviations from Arrhenius kinetics with nearly temperature independent tunnelling below {\textasciitilde}70 K and a thermally activated behaviour above {\textasciitilde}100 K. The range of 12 orders of magnitude in the low temperature tunnelling rate can be understood in terms of nonadiabatic multiphonon relaxation, where in the strong coupling limit, with the Huang-Rhys parameter S much larger than the reduced energy gap p, an inverse energy gap law holds.},

Therefore, the modified CVR-B3LYP functional is designed to use the appropriate portions of HF exchange, 70\%, 50\%, and 20\%, for K-shell, L-shell, and valence regions separately. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations with the modified CVR-B3LYP functional yield both K-shell and L-shell excitation energies with reasonable accuracy. The modified CVR-B3LYP also provides valence-excitation energies and standard enthalpies of formation accurately.

The comparison with the experimental data is good, especially for the Ti 2p shell which cannot be described even qualitatively by the too simple Kohn–Sham method. Also the Cl 2p shell, dominated by Rydberg features, is properly described. The method is computationally economic, and can be applied to larger and less symmetric systems.

We show that the LC scheme completely fails to improve the poor accuracy of conventional generalized gradient approximation functionals, while the LCgau scheme gives an accuracy which is an order of magnitude better than BLYP and significantly better than B3LYP. A reoptimization of the two parameters controlling the inclusion of short-range HF exchange in the LCgau method enables the errors to be reduced to the order of 0.1 eV which is competitive with the best DFT methods we are aware of. This reparametrization does not affect the LC scheme and therefore maintains the high accuracy of predicted reaction barrier heights. Moreover, while there is some loss in accuracy in thermochemical predictions compared to the previously optimized LCgau-BOP, rms errors in the atomization energies over the G2 test set are found to be comparable to B3LYP. Finally, we attempt to rationalize the success of the LC and LCgau schemes in terms of the well-known self-interaction error (SIE) of conventional functionals. To estimate the role of the SIE, we examine the total energy calculations for systems with a fractional number of electrons, not only in the highest occupied molecular orbital but also in the 1 s -characterized core orbital. Our conclusion is that the inclusion of short-range HF exchange in LC-type functionals can significantly alleviate the problems of the SIE in the core region. In particular, we confirm that the absence of the SIE diagnostics in the core orbital energies correlates with the accurate prediction of core-excitation energies using the newly optimized LCgau approach.},
